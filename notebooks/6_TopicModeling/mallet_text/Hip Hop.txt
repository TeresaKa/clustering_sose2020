 you didn't pray for me when i was local  and as i lay these vocals  i think of all the shit i had to go through  just to get to where i'm at  i've already told you at least    a thousand times in these rhymes  i appreciate the prayer  but i've already got  god on my side  and it's been one hell of a ride  hasn't it?

 let me go crazy  crazy on you  oh  can't you see what you do to me baby   you make me crazy  you make me act like a maniac  i'm like a lunatic  you make me sick  you're truly the only one who can do this to me  you just make me get so crazy  i go schizo  i get so insane i just go schizophrenic  one minute i want to slit your throat the next i want to sex  you make me crazy  the way we act like two maniacs in the sack  we fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe that's a bad habit  'cause the next day we right back at it  in the same exact pattern  what the fuck is the matter with us  we can't figure out if it's lust  or it's love which that is attractin' us to each other  they say that every man grows up to marry his own mother  which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch  but i stay and still stick it out with you  even though i just hit you today but you deserved it  you hit me first and provoked me to choke you  just 'cause i came home late last night  crawled in bed and i woke you  but if there's one thing about you that i admire  it's baby  because you stay with me  maybe 'cause you're as crazy as i am  'cause when i look at you  i can see an angel in your eyes but if i look deeper inside  i see a freakish little side  like a devil in disguise  you're always full of surprises  always pullin' devices out your purse  little vibrators and dildos  you fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore  you're only twenty four but you're plenty more mature  than those other little hoes who just act like little girls  like they're in middle school still you're crazy  sexy  cool  chill you play your position you never step out of line  even though i stay in your business  you've always kept out of mine  i wonder what's on your mind  sometimes they say love is blind  maybe that's why the first time i dotted your eye  you didn't see the sign  or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved  maybe cause we're crazy in love    let me go crazy on you  crazy on you  let me go crazy  crazy on you  oh  you are the ink to my paper  what my pen is to my my pad  the moral  the very fiber  the whole substance to my rap  you are my reason for being  the meaning of my existence  if it wasn't for you i would never be able to spit this  as intense as i do  and the irony  is you rely on me as much  as i rely on you to inspire me like you do  you provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire  you're my entire supply of gas  the match and igniter  the only way that i'm able to stay so stable  is you're the legs to my table   if you were to break i'd fall on my face  but i'm always gonna make you feel  i don't need you as much as i really need you  so you don't use it to your advantage  but you're essential to me  you're the air i breathe  i believe if you ever leave me  i'd probably have no reason to be  you are the kim to my marshall  you're the slim to my shady  the dre to my eminem  the alana to my hailie  you are the word that i'm lookin for  when i'm tryin' to describe how i feel inside  and the right one just won't come to my mind  you're like the pillar that props me up  the beam that supports me  the bitch who never took half  the wife who never divorced me  you're like the root to my evil  you let my devil come out me  you let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me  and no matter how much too much is never enough  maybe 'cause we're crazy in love    let me go crazy on you  crazy on you  let me go crazy  crazy on you oh lord please forgive for what i do  for i know not what i've done.    father

his sweater already  mom's spaghetti  he's nervous  but on the surface he looks calm and ready  to drop bombs  but he keeps on forgettin'  what he wrote down  the whole crowd goes so loud  he opens his mouth  but the words won't come out  he's chokin'  how  everybody's jokin' now  the clocks run out  times up  over  blaow!  snap back to reality  oh there goes gravity  oh  there goes rabbit  he choked  he's so mad  but he won't give up that easy? no  he won't have it  he knows his whole back city's ropes  it don't matter  he's dope  he knows that  but he's broke  he's so stacked that he knows  when he goes back to his mobile home  that'swhen its  back to the lab again yo  this whole rhapsody  he better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him    [chorus: x2]  you better lose yourself in the music  the moment  you own it  you better never let it go  you only get one shot  do not miss your chance to blow  this opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better    the souls escaping  through this hole that its gaping  this world is mine for the taking  make me king  as we move toward a  new world order  a normal life is borin'  but super stardom's close to post mortar  it only grows harder  only grows hotter  he blows us all over these hoes is all on him  coast to coast shows  he's known as the globetrotter  lonely roads  god only knows  he's grown farther from home  he's no father  he goes home and barely knows his own daughter  but hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water  his hoes don't want him no mo  he's cold product  they moved on to the next schmo who flows  he nose dove and sold nada  so the soap opera is told and unfolds  i suppose it's old partna  but the beatgoes on  da da dumb da dumb da da    [chorus: x2]    no more games  i'm a change what you call rage  tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged  i was playin' in the beginnin'  the mood all changed  i been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage  but i kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher  best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper  all the pain inside amplified by the  fact that i can't get by with my nine to  five and i can't provide the right type of  life for my family 'cause man  these god damn food stamps don't buy diapers  and its no movie  there's no mekhi phifer   this is my life and these times are so hard  and it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed  plus  see dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna   baby mama drama screamin' on and too much  for me to want to say in one spot  another jam or not  has gotten me to the point  i'm like a snail i've got  to formulate a plot fore i end up in jail or shot  success is my only motherfuckin' option  failures not  mom  i love you  but this trail has got to go  i cannot grow old in salem'slot  so here i go is my shot.  feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that i got    [chorus: x2]    you can do anything you set your mind to  man yo  yeah girl   can you hear that? it's playing our song  are you sleepy? take a nap  you're not afraid of the dark? are you?    you hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep  i knock on dakota's door  its locked so i go to creep  round the back  with binoculars  not cause i wanna peep  but because i'm hungry she smells like tacos i wanna eat  visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are

hear me out this much you owe me  i gave up my life for you  totally devoted to you while i've stayed  faithful all the way this is how i fucking get repaid  look at how i dress fucking baggy sweats  go to work a mess  always in a rush to get back to you i ain't heard you yet  not even once say you appreciate me i deserve respect  i've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness  and i know that if i end this i'll no longer have nothing left  but you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step  and i wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath  you know what you've done no need to go in depth  i told you  you'd be sorry if i fucking left  i'd laugh while you wept  hows it feel now  yeah  funny ain't it  you neglected me  did me a favor although my spirit free you've said  but a special place for you in my heart i have kept  its unfortunate but its      too late for the other side  caught in a chase  twenty five to life  too late for the other side  caught in a chase  twenty five to life    i feel like when i bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh  cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half  til i snap  don't think i'm loyal  all i do is rap  i can not moonlight on the side  i have no life outside of that  don't i give you enough of my time  you don't think so do you  jealous when i spend time with the girls  why i'm married to you still man i don't know  but tonight i'm serving you with papers  i'm divorcing you  go marry someone else and make 'em famous  and take away there freedom like you did to me

my sickness and addiction  your as addictive as they get  evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em  my friends keep asking why i cant just walk away  i'm addicted  to the pain  the stress  the drama  i'm drown in so i guess i'm a mess  cursed and blessed  but this time i'm a  ain't changing my mind  i'm climbing out this abyss  you screaming as i walk out that i'll be missed  but when you spoke to people who meant the most to you  you left me off your list    fuck you hip-hop  i'm leaving you  my life sentence is served bitch  and its just        too late  caught in a change  twenty five to life just gonna stand there and watch me burn  but that's alright  because i like the way it hurts  just gonna stand there and hear me cry  but that's alright  because i love the way you lie  i love the way you lie    i can't tell you what it really is  i can only tell you what it feels like  and right now there's a steel knife  in my windpipe  i can't breathe  but i still fight  while i can fight  as long as the wrong feels right  it's like i'm in flight  high off of love drunk from my hate  it's like i'm huffing paint and i love it the more that i suffer  i suffocate and right before i'm about to drown  she resuscitates me  she fucking hates me   and i love it  wait  where you going  i'm leaving you  no you ain't  come back  we're running right back  here we go again  it's so insane 'cause when it's going good  it's going great  i'm superman  with the wind at his back  she's lois lane  but when it's bad  it's awful  i feel so ashamed  i snapped  who's that dude  i don't even know his name  i laid hands on her  i'll never stoop so low again  i guess i don't know my own strength    just gonna stand there and watch me burn  but that's alright  because i like the way it hurts  just gonna stand there and hear me cry  but that's alright  because i love the way you lie  i love the way you lie  i love the way you lie    you ever love somebody so much  you can barely breathe  when you're with them  you meet  and neither one of you  even know what hit 'em   got that warm fuzzy feeling  yeah them chills  used to get 'em  now you're getting fucking sick  of looking at 'em  you swore you've never hit 'em  never do nothing to hurt 'em   now you're in each others face   spewing venom  and these words  when you spit 'em  you push  pull each other's hair  scratch  claw  bit 'em   throw 'em down  pin 'em  so lost in the moments  when you're in 'em  it's the rage that's the culprit  it controls you both  so they say it's best  to go your separate ways   guess that they don't know ya 'cause today  that was yesterday  yesterday is over  it's a different day  sound like broken records  playin' over  but you promised her  next time you'll show restraint  you don't get another chance   life is no nintendo game  but you lied again  now you get to watch her leave   out the window  guess that's why they call it window pane    just gonna stand there and watch me burn  but that's alright  because i like the way it hurts  just gonna stand there and hear me cry  but that's alright  because i love the way you lie  i love the way you lie  i love the way you lie    now i know we said things  did things  that we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns  same routine  but your temper's just as bad  as mine is  you're the same as me  but when it comes to love  you're just as blinded  baby please come back  it wasn't you   baby it was me  maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems  maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano  all i know is i love you too much  to walk away now  come inside  pick up your bags off the sidewalk  don't you hear sincerity  in my voice when i talk   told you this is my fault  look me in the eyeball  next time i'm pissed  i'll aim my fist at the dry wall  next time  there will be no next time  i apologize even though i know it's lies  i'm tired of the games  i just want her back  i know i'm a liar  if she ever tries to fucking leave again  i'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire    just gonna stand there and watch me burn  but that's alright  because i like the way it hurts  just gonna stand there and hear me cry  but that's alright  because i love the way you lie  i love the way you lie  i love the way you lie  just ball till you fall  cuz imma ball until i fall  so you'd

best at this husslin' shit  but his downfall was that he put his trust in a bitch and it's fucked up        [fabolous]  i remember selling three bricks of raw powder  turn my man into a star in 24 hours  he didn't care spent the money in like 4 hours  on a benz with like 400 and horsepower  and a chain that had christ on it  a rollie with a lot of ice on it  a pinky ring with a price on it  when he come around  its likely that he blunted  with a pretty lady in them nike's that you wanted  it's well know he kept it on his hip like a cell phone  if you speak with him you can pick up on his jail tone  he used to say he wasn't going back without blowing back  and now i'm black i wouldn't put it past him  the d's would harass him  til he finally blacked out  they told my nigga to freeze  but he still backed out  shots fired 'til his trigger finger got tired  all the newspapers said was 'another nigga dead'  and it's fucked up        [fabolous]  you can catch me in a cherry red 8-50

about hurtin' his girl  so he used to tell his queen to stay to the castle  away from the hassle to the day that he pass through  there's some enemies he might have who may want to blast you  she stayed for a few years  that's until a few pairs  convinced her to come and hang out around new year's  it's been awhile  you can see it in her smile  and she ran into her man's co-defendant in the trial  who started going on about how he moving on  about running with them same niggas smitty had warned about  she slid off told her girl  she had to drop her kid off  they found her in the parking lot  somebody blew her lid off  and it's fucked up    [chorus: x2] baby girl  you know my situation  and sometimes i know you get impatient  but you don't put to on a show to get patience  take it to

stomach to hide me  from all that worry and bullshit  nine months later  i elbow pull and kick  cause my time is up and i don't care  with one big push  i'm outta there  june 15th  it's just my luck  in 1969  a nigga is the product    "ghetto ass nigga  you ain't shit   and you ain't gon' never be shit!"    i learned how to walk and talk and all that  they put me in school  but it don't matter  cause i'm sittin' in history  learnin' bout a sucker  who didn't give a fuck about me  they try to shape us  but i know uncle sam is a motherfuckin' rapist  so i stopped payin' attention  ice cube  headed  straight to detention  fuck that shit  i roam the hallways  i'm sent home and i don't got all a's  a high school dropout  my father had beef so i tried to knock pops out  but i got tossed  he's the boss  i'm out of there and mad cause i lost  now bein' on my own is a factor  so i become  the neighborhood jacker  gimme your car  run your jewels  makin' a livin' robbin' fools  and if i let my nine rang out  you know  it'll make your brains hang out  so what's your fate?  am i the nigga you love  or the one you love to hate?  the wrong answer is said  the nigga fled  i pump lead  now he's in a puddle of red  and if you got a buck  you're shit out of luck  stuck up by the motherfuckin' product    "uh-uh motherfucker you gots to get a job  if you want to stay in my motherfuckin' house"    "many young men reject the traditional values  that are important to their parents.  church  school and family  have been replaced by street  turf  and gang."    twenty-one now  and paid in full  feelin' bad  from all the shit i pulled  on people back in the day  plus  i got a little baby on the way  so i'm tryin' to go straight  i'm with my baby's momma  out on a date  til the punk ass cops ran my plate  now i'm on a bus upstate    "oh  the young nigga done caught a case!"  "sittin' in the mess hall  sayin' my grace"    sent to a concrete hoe-house  where all the products go  no doubt  yo momma  i gotta do eleven  livin' in a five by seven  dear baby  your man's gettin' worn out  of seein' young boys gettin' they assholes torn out  and then he got shanked with a spoon  and he was 'sposed to get out soon  is it my fault  he was caught in production  where a young black life means nothin'  just because  i didn't want to learn your grammar  you say i'm better off in the slammer  and it's drivin' me batty  cause my little boy  is missin' daddy  i'm ashamed  but the fact is  i wish pops let me off on the mattress  or should i just hang from the top bunk  but that's goin out like a punk  my life is fucked!  but it ain't my fault  cause i'm the motherfuckin' product    "he ain't shit" mr. dirty harry  you look really scary  with your .357  officer kevin  spent 11 years on the force trying to get mine  head got the flat top  boots got the spit shine  don't give a fuck about my neighborhood  just wanna do your eight hours  then hit the showers  shoot a brother down adn you don't send flowers  goddamn sherrif  can't wait to tarriff  a chunk of a nigga ass  but watch a nigga blast  and get away nigga fast  you ain't gonna have me face down no more  you ain't gonna have a chance to clown no more  to the boys in blue  i got kids too  ain't going out like a jigaboo  no no no  on my way to the store  you see me in a range rover  now you gotta pull me over  but where oh where is the ticket?  you got your hand on your gun cause you're wicked  you don't like the face of the original man  but you gotta treat me like an individual man  talk right and i'll talk right back  show some goddamn respect to the black  cause i gotta get back to my wife  but i'm sorry  you ain't gonna take my life    just because you got a badge  did you think ice cube was gonna wave the white flag?  cracker please  you can yell freeze  i'd rather die standing up than die on my knees  you think you can do anything you want to do  to my crew when you come through  man fuck you  shooting up south central  catch your ass slipping at a rent show  could have popped you off  one dead cop  but i know you got a wife and a dog named spot  i show a little mercy cause i'm civilized  looking through a nigga's eyes at a much bigger prize  but when i saw rodney it got me so hot  made me wanna go out and pop me a cop  cause every time you see me sagging  here comes the grand dragon  in the motherfucking patty wagon  try to play me like a trick  sometimes you act like a dick  mr. nightstick  back then  i used to throw my mack-10  but nowadays you got the black skin  back then you don't like the voice of a nigga named ice  but you ain't gonna take my life    you man let's get an understanding  i know that your job is demanding  but i only got me one life to live  you only got about six shots to give  and i got a big ak with a 50-round clip  so why should we trip?  you ain't gonna punk me  so what you trying for?  ain't no job worth dying for  is it?  might pay a visit to petey wheatstraw  when you stop me on the shore  officer of the law  and if i did something wrong  you can lock me up  never never never gonna sock me up  so next time you have the urge  all of the sudden  to fuck with a nigga for nothing  think about me  a brother that's 23  i got a son and a j-o-b  so before you pull your gun  you'd better think twice  pig  cause you ain't gonna take my life   in any country prison is where society sends it's failures  but in this country society itself is failing.    today how you like me now i'm in the mix?  it's 1986 and i got the fix with the chicken and a quota  got the baking soda let the water boil workers all loyal  dropped out the twelve'th

like me  is down for whatever    and i'm down for whatever    when i was little i didn't want to be like mike  i wanted to be like ike  cause  papa was a rolling stone in the sixties  and he liked green like bill bixby  told me that my best friend was a ten and a twenty  pokets never skinny  played let's get it on in the living room  and hwne he gets drunk you better give him room  cause he'll turn the party out sayin'  "this is my motherfuckin' house"  and y'all gots to go  through the door  and if you can't find the door  he'll help you with the four-four  talkin' much shit on the grass

so don't fuck with me  i fucked that lady in the bed  i missed that pussy and i bust a spread  i tried it again in a thumping wagon  the bottom fell out and her ass started dragging  tried it again and i failed to grasp  i missed that pussy and i bust my ass  then i fucked this lady in the tree  the baby came out and said "run-dmc"    i knew this girl who looked just like you  light brown and a fly hair-do  i wanted to do her  screw her  so i stepped to her  on-key bitch had more ass than a donkey  i said you're the type of girl that i can't pass over  give me one chance and i'll bend your ass over  just call me the plumber at the end of the night  cause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe  she didn't get offended it was splendid to me  cause mister nice guy is what i pretended to be  i guess i just wine her and dine her  and by the end of the night i'll be behind her  waxing that ass like rain dance  on the bumper get the pussy then i dump her  took her to the comfort inn  tucked her in  pulled out the third leg pumped it in  she said will you call me  yeah i'll call you a bitch or a hoe after i ball ya  naw i'm just playin' but it's still the same  cause a nigga like ice cube is only out for one thing women they're good for nothing no maybe one thing  to serve needs to my ding-a-ling  i'm a man who loves the one-night stand  cause after i do ya  huh i never knew ya  cause to kick it man it gives me the fits  they wanna lay with they nose under your armpits  ice cube won't wait so give it up cow  after we do it you can go home now  i'm a brother with a big long...    first of all let me tell you my name it's yo-yo  when down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no  yo-yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in  niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in  no  yo-yo's not a hoe or a whore  and if that's what you're here for  exit through the door  there's more  to see of me but you're blind so  women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0    ay what up buttercupper miss yo-yo  i know you like to rap and like to flow so  but when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world  stay down and play the playground you little girl    what you're saying i don't consider it as rapping  cause you're on rewind and i'm the new what's-happening  it never fails i'll always get respect  and you lose so take a rain check    hell no cause you know that i'm first and you're second  if it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant  and barefoot complaining that your back is aching  shaking and faking while i'm bringing home the bacon    well you're mistaken  it's not going that far  i make brothers like you play the back yard  you used to flow with the title but i took it  bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it    damn it look it  cause you're talking a lot of bull    well i'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull    this is a man's world thank you very much    but it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch    ah miss yo-yo so what gives  i hear females always talkin about women's lib  well get your own crib  and stay there  instead of having more babies for the welfare  cause if you don't i'll label you a gold digger  the name is ice cube you know that i ain't the nigga  for you to look at when your hair get nappy  so take a piece of the pole and be happy    hell no because to me you're not a thriller  you come in the room with your three-inch killer  thinking you can do damage to my backbone  leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown  i'm a put it like this my man  without us your hand would be your best friend  so give us credit like you know you should  if i don't look good you don't look good    i doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant    but you don't know how funky that i can get    this is a man's world thank you very much    but it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch    man women i put a lot of fear in em  cause i had it up to here with em  drink a beer with em  no way cause i can only deal with em about an hour every day  yeah if you know what i mean baby    well i guess now that i think about it i think maybe  if you was more of a man instead of faking it  women deserve the credit when they're making it    yeah so what's the problem    well i think we solved it  i know they know the best male from who's doggin it    yeah i admit you can flow    well that's true    but you see i'm a pro with the bank too    yeah i can see you got it good    oh that i know    but you see you're not better than yo-yo  the brand-new intelligent black lady    you're kinda dope but you still can't fade me    so what up then    girl what you tryin to do    to prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through    this is a man's world thank you very much    but

o.g.'s and my skin is my sin    my s-k-i-n is my s-i-n "burning our black skin"  my s-k-i-n is my s-i-n "burning our black skin" verse one: ice cube    peace. haha don't make me laugh!  all i hear is muthafucker's talkin' sucotash  livin' large  tellin' me to get out the gang  i'm a nigga  gotta live by the trigger  how the fuck do you figure?  that i can say peace and the gunshots won't cease  every cop killin' goes ignored  they just send another nigga to the morgue  a point scored- they could give a fuck about us  they rather catch us with guns and white powder  if i was old  they'd probably be a friend of me  since i'm young  they consider me the enemy  they kill ten of me to get the job correct  to serve  protect  and break a niggas neck  'cause i'm the one with the trunk of funk  and 'fuck tha police' in the tape deck  you should listen to me 'cause there's more to see  call my neighborhood a ghetto 'cause it houses minorities  the other color don't know you can run but not hide  these are tales from the darkside...    verse two:    you wanna free africa  i stare at yuh  'cause we ain't got it too good in america  i can't fuck with them overseas  my homeboy died over a key of cocaine  it was plain and simple  the 9mm went to the temple  was the sound i put the bitch down  and ran to the schoolyard bathroom  looked in the trash can yo it had room  so i ducked my ass in it for a minute  covered with sweat i had the layback  mad as fuck  thinkin' about the payback  tonite the crew gonna have a little fun  i went home and cocked the barrel of my shotgun  it's gettin' critical - i start the five point o  there they go - drive real slow  i yelled out 'ice cube sucka'  shot gun hit - and murder mutahfuckers  i told you last album  when i got a sawed off  bodies are hard off  its a shame  that niggas die young  but to the light side it don't matter none  it'll be a drive by homicide  but to me it's just another tale from the darkside...    verse three: chuck d    standing in the middle of war  the middle we flex  when we die  they won't make check  ebony can't see to the darkside  the term they apply to us is a nigga  call it what you want  'cause i'm comin' from the coroner  same applies with a phd  who'z black - don't wanna role - sells his soul  watch his head go rollin'  who the fuck are they foolin'?  nobody knows  but i suppose the color of my clothes  matches the color of the one on my face as they wonder what's under my waist  [standin on the verge] of them gettin' brown  that's a fact got a fear on their bozack  run  run  run  their ass off  they can not hide  yet cube  they can't fuck with the darkside! it's like a holocaust to the boss when i toss  too much knowledge kicked then you're lost  in a shuffle of feet jinx the fiddler  and i control your mind like hitler  you bow and vow to authority  see now a sucker with a style just boring me  so i show k.n.o.w.  l.e.d.g.e. it might trouble you  then i transform like a deception  with a mic as a bomb  in my right palm  but i don't stay calm  so panic  others can't flow so they go schizophrenic  you thought i dropped a dud in your face  until you taste the blood of the bass  then you faint  or better yet pass out  when i'm on the mic  believe it's ass out  you think you're raw so you draw  you lose  you're hung  you bite your tongue  the whole town saw in awe as you strangle  a noose on your neck  and you dangle  from side to side in the blazing heat  you're beat  you're dead  the fools fell off  you feel you're turning red  it's said  that your head burst  and this is only the first verse  of the bomb    don't break up the fight let them rumble  over the years i've watched some go super-bad quick  now the smell of the pen has got them sick to the stomach  now ask yourself  who's stupid?  i take funky funky beats and i loop it  and pimp slap you in the face with the bass  and the boom from the bomb that i drop  stop  you have a flat top as a fashion  i love black women with a passion  but when they gotta go and show their ass in  i gotta clown the hoes  yeah  you gotta watch the ones with the big derrieres  they'll steer you wrong  ice cube's got it going on  hit me  for the gangster boogie two times for the gangster rhyme  the system ain't wholesome  they want to put a young brother in folsom  and others see me on lockdown  but i come up foul then they get knocked out  word  to the brother that rolls the herb  everybody getting knocked to the curb like that  jinx got the gat  and it's a fact  he'll kick a funky beat to peel your cap  now who's the mack?  who's the hoe?  who's the trick?  i got many  many styles won't you take a pick  but don't be alarmed  when i trip and stumble and fumble  and drop the  rewind   drop the bomb    i'm solo  you ask how i'm living  still dropping more shit than a pigeon  with the l  the e  the n  the see  the h   the m  the o  the be   the great  lyrics that make the beat swing and i gotcha  it's the hip-hopper that don't like coppers  and if you try to upset the pot son  you get kicked in the chest like a shotgun  i make the beats  i make the breaks  i make the rhymes that make you shake  make you find  ice cube never caught in the middle  i make shit to kick you in the ass a little  and still never hesitate to stutter step  or bust a repetition on the mic  still dissing all

"ahh  seeya!"  i ran home. i couldn't stop thinking  about his eyeball winking and blinking.  and it looked not a damn thing like the other. ugh!  shoulda wore a patch on the motherfucker.  it hypnotized me  mesmerized me.  traumatized  paralyzed  terrorized me.  creepers  where'd you get that ball?  and tell me how it even fits in your skull.    i want a big long knife to stick it in.  i want to lift up the eyelid and kick it in.  he's gotta die. i want his eye buried in my backyard.  it ain't hard  i'm killin' old evil eye!      evil eye...  oh-oh-eye  the bitch gon' die! die-die-die-die-die-die-die   evil eye...  oh oh    "now this is the point. you fancy me mad. madmen know nothing. but you  should've seen me. you should have seen how wisely i proceeded with cautionwith  what  foresight  with what patience i went to work. i was never kinder to the oldman  than  during the whole week before i killed him."    a day gone pass since i heard about j.o.  met up in this sleigh  'cause i don't fuckin' play.  anyway  i gotta do him in. got a rusty revolver  put the silver bullets in.  i'm plannin' on playin' one right to his nugget.  down my drawers with the bucket.  it's time to go  fuck it.  i stuck it up... to his neck when he came to the door.  i really didn't know what i was in for.  first the cold man stared  no a gaze  no a stare.  kinda like there was no one there.  how weird  my body froze with the blink of his eye.  evil eye  sendin' chills up my spine.  what to do? what to do? i gotta try to break.  i gotta try to make.. my way to the gate.  wait. i can't move  i'm stuck to the ground.  w-what the fuck was that? i think i heard a sound   turned around  there it was  starin' at my face.  this little old man's eye's a make me a mental case.  that's when i felt the pain deep inside   deep inside  now his eye's open wide.    i want a big long knife to stick it in.  i want to lift up the eyelid and kick it in.  he's gotta die. i want his eye buried in my backyard.  it ain't hard  i'm killin' old evil eye!        "that night it ceased. the old man was dead. i placed my hands on the heartand  there for many minutes there was no pulsation. he was stone dead. his eye will  trouble me  no longer. his eye will trouble me no longer."

died in class they would probably say they knew me  or they wouldn't care  they wouldn't even move  a dead body rotting in the back of the room  for weeks and months  stinking up the class  until somebody noticed then they throw me in the trash  i can hear the teacher man talking about columbus  he nothing but an old dead fuck with a compass  ran up on a beach and threw everybody off  and then he claimed discovery and now we all applaud  i don't give a fuck to learn your uncle went to hell  i'm trapped in mind and my brain is my cell  but i have a key  it's called insanity  i stick in my brain to unlock eternity  just a nobody and i think it's a drag  but i got mr. johnson's head in my bookbag  [chorus  2x ]  "okay  today we're gonna learn about a great freedom. if you'll turn  your

about the games  that i had played with many hearts and i'm not saying no names  then the thought occurred  tear drops made my eyes burn  as i said to myself  "look what you've done to her"  i can

amore  kissing you on the ear  whispering "i love you" and "i'll always be near"  although i often reminisce  i can't believe that i've found  a desire for true love  floating around  inside my soul  because my soul is cold  one half of me deserves to be this way till i'm old  but the other half  needs affection and joy  and the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy  i need love    i need

but you still want to squawk  can't get a decent contract  your beats ain't workin'  dogged-out pumas plus you're manager's jerkin'  your mic sounds weak  remember that sieezer  i'm badder than napoleon  hitler or caesar  i'm a hit man  but i'm not for hire  fly girl's desire  the man you admire  not only on the stage  i rock in the park  and i'm a killer in the daytime  and worse after dark  so don't never ever mess with the king of the sound  l.l. cool j  the baddest around. he man  i've seen ya   think ya rockin' it on the floor   you look like a moron!  who let you in the door?  to put the question bluntly  maybe your feet's deformed.  they should slap you in the teeth  when you put your dancing shoes on.  you can't dance!    why don't you just nail your feet to the floor?  homeboy  what's the use?  anytime you wanna step aside a party   first think of an excuse.  you dance like a fat old lady  not sayin' that fat old ladies ain't nice   but every time you try to get one move right.  the old lady then did it twice.  you can't dance!    you've been a dancing disco disaster   the worst i ever saw.  they should dropkick you on the neck  and drag you off the floor.  in every discotheque  i see you there  in the middle of the crowd   looking like you got eight or nine  left feet dragging all around.  you can't dance!    take my advice  don't move!  you'll never get the knack.  if i danced like you i'd sneak out the party  and wouldn't be coming back.  on the floor you're a dinosaur   yeah boy  that's how you move.  you look like ralph cramden or a donald duck cartoon.  you can't dance!    you wanna come to my party?  i wouldn't give you a chance.  you tried to take break-dance lessons   ended up in an ambulance.  wouldn't it be funny if they put you on solid gold?  you dance like you got arthritis already   what'll happen when you get old?  you can't dance!    why are you so stiff?  is it something that your mother did?  maybe you grew up around "can't dance" people  when you were a "can't dance" kid.  you live in a "can't dance" house   went out in a "can't dance" car   your doofy "can't dance" father  got drunk in a "can't dance" bar.  you take a "can't dance" bath   put on your "can't dance" cologne.  go out to a "can't dance" party  so you wouldn't have to "can't dance" all alone.  you can't dance!    homeboy  will you please get off the floor  you moron? the momentum of this party can only increase  the design of this rhyme is a masterpiece  you'll want to kick steps to the musical feast  and witness the force i'm about to release  you'll rock!    i'm a professional producer of hip-hop songs  in case you're unaware my beats are always strong  i'll exterminate your crew if i don't like you  with one rhyme i subdue my

besides he drinks too much  and smokes too many blunts    and i'll be working out everyday thinkin' about you  looking at my own eyes in the rear view  catching flashbacks of our eye contact  wish i

about to make a call  i had a vision it was me on the other end  telling you come by and then you walked in    i touched you gently with my hands  we talked about traveling the distant lands  escaping all the madness out here in the world  becoming my wife no longer my girl    then you let your dress fall down to the floor  oh yeah   i kissed you softly and you yearned for more  we experienced pleasure unparalleled  into an ocean of love we both fell    swimming in the timeless currents of pure bliss  fantasies interchanging with each kiss  undying passion unites our souls  together we swim until the point of no control    but  it's a fantasy  you won't come true  we never even spoke and your man swears he love you  so  i'm gonna keep all these feelings aside   that's right   keep my

started chewin' on my ice  her smile was bananas  teeth was pearly white  that's when i realized it'll be a long night  the vibe was right  she was laced in all white  her french manicure traced the crown on my mic  you ever try to focus  resist with all your might  but every sip you take pulls you deeper in the hype      i'm talkin' tan lines  belly rings and things  dj rubbin' my thing  makin'

maybe you a honey and it's hard to keep calm  cause you sippin' on somethin' and homeboy's the bomb  you dancin' in your seat  and singin' along  and every sip makes you feel like you need to perform  the party is packed  it's just a little too warm  but you take another sip to prove that you strong        take it to the bridge    i can't call it  i can't tell  honestly  i'm drunk as hell  uh-huh

and metaphors needs work  and he lost respect for the game  ah let me see  think you can save him?    ok.  respect is in the heart.  so that's where i'm a start.  and a lot of heart patients don't make it.  now hey kid  plural i graduated  cause you could get through anything if magic made it.  and that was called recycling  or re-reciting  something cause you just like it  so you say it just like it.  some say its biting  but i say its enlightening  besides  dr. kanye west is one of the brightest.  and dr. swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.  and dr. jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.  arthritis in my hand from writing.  but i'm a doctor they don't understand my writing.  so i stop writing.  now i'm like lighting.  and you ain't vince young so don't clash with the

one looks much better then the others  his respect is back up  concepts sound good his style is showing strong signs of improvement  all he needs now is some swagger  ok let me take my gloves off then    swagger tighter then a yeast infection.  fly go hard like geese erection.  fashion patrol police detection.  i stay tight like chinese connection.  i stay tight like pussy at night.  baby don't get me wrong i could do that pussy right.  but i'm too wrong to write.  too fresh to fight.  too paid to freestyle.  too paid to freestyle.  i had to say it twice  swagger so nice.  and don't ask me shit unless it concern a price.  and i don't rap fast i rap slow.  cause i mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes.  swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats.  that swagger i got it i wear it like a coat.  wait  as i put the light down his throat.  i can only see flow.  his blood starting to flow.  his lungs starting to grow.  this one starting to show.  strong signs of life.

what i meant by "rebel" and  they just take it to the streets...    [one and only verse]    ok  yeah  alright...  i find it hard to say  that everything is alright  don't look at me that way  like everything is alright  cuz my own eyes can see  through all your false pretenses  but what you fail to see  is all the consequences  you think our lives are cheap  and easy to be wasted  as history repeats  so foul you can taste it  and while the people sleep  too comfortable to face it  his life so incomplete  and nothing can replace it  and while the people sleep  too comfortable to face it  your lives so incomplete  and nothing can replace it  fret not thyself i say  against these laws of man  cuz like the bible says  his blood is on their hands  and what i gotta say  and what i gotta say  is rebel  while today is still today  choose well  and what i gotta say  is rebel  it can't go down this way  choose well  choose well  choose well...  ...choose well  choose well  choose well  and while the people sleep  too comfortable to face it  your lives are so incomplete  and nothing  and no one  can replace it  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  and what i gotta say  and what i gotta say  and what i gotta say  and what i gotta say  and what i gotta say  and what i gotta say  and what i gotta say  and what i gotta say  is rebel... rebel  rebel  rebel  rebel  rebel  rebel  rebel  rebel  rebel  rebel  rebel  repent  the day is far too spent  rebel... rebel!  wake up  wake up  wake up  wake up  wake up  wake up  wake up...  wake up and rebel  we must destroy in order to rebuild  wake up  you might as well  oh are you... oh are you satisfied  oh are you satisfied  rebel... ohhh rebel  why don't you rebel  why don't you rebel?  why don't you rebel?  i'm fading myself down now... ok. oh no! not you!  what are you doing here?  oh boy it's gonna be hard now  can we put him in the back?  robin  robin  robin    i used to get dressed for you all   i don't do that no more  i'm sorry  it's a new day  i don't have the energy    y'all like my jokes?    ok so  ah  these are brand new songs  that a very few people have heard hm  very much about  you know  whatever  i been going trough and what i been  learning lot of her  wonderful life lessons  you know  that are easy tocombine  but you're very blessed after you realize why you had to go trough what youhad  to go trough  is it very important that you really listen to the words  you  know  and if you have a hard time to hear what i'm saying please raise yourhand  you know  object  whatever  you guys ready in there?  all set  ok    and i  you know  it's really interesting because i used to  i used to be a performer   and i really don't consider myself a performer so much anymore   i'm really just  you know i'm sharing  you know   more or less the music that i've been giving   but if i stop  if i start  if i  you know   feel like saying "baby  baby  baby" for   eighteen bars  whatever  you know   i just i do that    so you guys are cool?  yeah!   ok i'm talking to people in my head too   it's alright though.. this is worth my "ape lope"  i'm just gonna finish sucking on my lazenger    ok so this particular song is called mr. intentional  "will see  we tune that now"  this is  one "ape lope" can i get some of that tea  some of that tea. i know i sound rhaspy but that's  hey  i used to go on tour ya know  and i'd be a prisoner  i used to be a  prisoner on tour cause i would go on tour and tour your'e supposed to enjoyand  have a good time but i'd be this prisoner in the hotel you know drinkin' tea  and ya know tellin' children ya know mommy has to sleep cause i wanted to  maintain this ya know emmaculate sounding voice  but that's not realistic  ya  know reality is sometimes i stay up late and this is what i sound like when i  wake up the next day  and ya know its a voice ya know and to me the the more i  uh focus less on myself the more i realize i can be used to spread a message   because when i am i used to be so ya know oh my god if i sound ya know harsh  and rhaspy i can't go out there  that's a lie ya know i just sound like a  singer with a lot of stuff in her throat.    so  i told the people at mtv that they gotta like me better if not then people  are gonna keep on sayin' who's that boy on stage. who's that little boy. ok   we're just finishing tune up  ok... i'll tell you every single-we all have gifts  you know  and uh  like specialgifts. and there's this voice inside of us that says "don't do that " youknow  "why you gonna get up there with that guitar? you're gonna like like a a hip hop folk singer. what are you  you know  what are you?..."   laughter   and i really went through  i mean  i'm serious  i mean i can laugh about itnow  but it took a long time for me to understand that  you know  what i am iswhat i am and i can't be afraid to  you know  to expose that to the public.you know  always-get in trouble trying to make it  tryin' to dress it up  youknow what i'm sayin'? just tired of that  you know. just tired of that. tiredof frontin'  tired of that... and until i find a group of people that are aspassionate about it as i am  i'll just roll alone until such time  you know.it's all good  god is faithful. y'all still get to hear it  so  you know?'cause see that enemy he would tell me  you know "you don't have the 20 pieceband  you can't do nothin'." i said  "yeah  sure... keep talkin'." 'causesomebody's gonna  they gonna see me and they gonna know "oh i  there'ssomethin' that god's been tellin me to do. i can do it  too. i can do what i'msupposed to be doin'  i don't need an entourage. what do i need a crew for?"that doesn't validate you. okay  let's see. mmmm...     i used to do it for the love a long time ago  and all i ever wanted was love  i used to love without fear a long time ago  and all i ever wanted was love  then somebody came around and tried to hurt me  tried to make me feel like i was unworthy  took a pure love and tried to make it dirty  truth was they never did deserve me  no!    i had to lose myself so i could love you better  i had to lose myself  had to lose myself so i could  love you better  had to lose myself  had to lose myself  so i could love you better  had to lose myself in love  and that's just the way it is'    couldn't tell me i was love when i needed it  when  all i ever wanted was love.  should a told me just me because!  i'm worth receiving it  but all i ever wanted was love  there's is something awkward about the selflessness it  takes to  give love and the good that it makes you!  true love can never really forsake you  but it took a little while just for me to see!    i had to lose myself so i could love you better  i had to lose myself  had to lose myself so i could  love you better  had to lose myself  had to lose myself  so i could love you better  had to lose myself in love  and that's just the way it is'    i had a paralyzing fear of facing failure  and i couldn't love you perfectly with fear in my head  so i peerlessly had to face the danger  so i could come back and love you whole instead  all of your soul i said!  so i could make it better    i had to lose myself so i could love you better  i had to lose myself  had to lose myself so i could  love you better  had to lose myself  had to lose myself  so i could love you better  had to lose myself in love  and that's just the way it is'    be-sec:  and so it goes that i never meant to hurt you  couldn't stay but i never meant to desert you  whole lot a things i just had to work through  time to heal and restore myself worth too  confrontation of my fears and anxiety  cried a whole lot years i suffered quietly  and though it may have taken years i can finally!  tell you that you were always on my mind!    i had to lose myself so i could make it better  i had to lose myself  had to lose myself so i could  make it better  had to lose myself  had to lose myself  so i could make it better  had to lose myself in love  and that was just the way!    takes strength to absorb all the abuse i did  great love to absorb all the misuse i did  hey baby it's not an excuse i give.  and i'd do it all again because for you i live    takes strength to absorb all the abuse i did  great love to absorb all the abuse i did  hey baby it's not an excuse i give.  and i'd do it all again because for you i live    i had to lose myself so i could make it better  i had to lose myself  had to lose myself so i could  make it better  had to lose myself  had to lose myself  so i could make it better  had to lose myself in love  and that was just the way!  and that was just the way it is' yeah  yeaaayh  yeah heh  yeah heh  yeah heh...  see the road to hell  is paved with good intentions  can't you tell  the way they have to mention  have they helped you

a fool  so i blame it on the sun  run away from everyone  hoping to escape this ridicule  trapped in misery  wrapped so miserably  and his deception i wear it like a skin    dying to maintain  while i

 maybe i blamed you for everything that was my mistake  in hindsight i loved your rawness and i loved your edge  'cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge  your earrings bamboo  your long nails too  your b.m.w. every time you came through  you was the braveheart  you stole wayne heart  you never switched it up  you played the same part  but i needed to grow  and i needed to know  that there were some things inside of me that i need to show  so i just deaded you  left you in all black  but dear old nicki  please call back    you told me you'd come when i needed you  and you said it so sweetly i believed you  but i'm standing here calling i cant see you  but i am holding you  holding you  holding you to that    yo  did i chase the glitz and glamor  money  fame and power  'cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour  i shoulda kept you with me gettin' at them nameless cowards  there was no match for you  couldn't defeat your prowess  i had to make them changes  i hope you understood  you see for every bad  i did a ton of good  but you was underground  and i was mainstream  i live the life now  that we would daydream  my only wish is you come enjoy

flavor  i make beats she rock rhymes so i gave a  a sample sound the she added a compound  word this is for those who haven't heard  a king and queen combine minds and trample  those who oppose us here's an example    it's time to run  the king and queen is on the set  the competition is petty and ready to step  to the first one  go ahead  rehearse one  i hope you don't know you sound like the worst one  rhymes are smoking  concentration can't be broken  queen latifah's outspoken  use your imagination  picture this  any male or female rapper trying to diss  here for excitement and enticement  with my competitors killed i go build with my enlightenment  teach the youth  feed the needy  confident descendant of queen nefertiti  the mother of civilization will rise  like the cream and still build the strong foundation  secondary but necessary to reproduce  acknowledge the fact that i'm black and i don't lack  queen latifah is giving you a piece of my mind  a rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher  rhymes i do employ  no time for slimy toys  i'm steady and stable and the label is tommy boy  backed by the unit  produced by the king  perfection pressed with the style that we bring  for the hip-hop patients  this is a king and queen creation    technician  musical musician  i'm stating the facts  strictly non-fiction  in hip-hop  you wonder who's in trouble most  creativity  you get a double dose  how can you stop me? no  i put you to a test  the rhymes are romeo  the beat's a juliet   with topic blend  this makes me a hard one  persevere  i'm here  gets taught one  strength producer  i send you an ultimatum  hardcore worldwide is how i take 'em  i rock  never hyperventilate  others get tired  could use a commercial break  45 king  dj mark's my alias  it takes a ton of m-c's to prevail against me  just listen  i'm unstoppable  you want a mission? this one's impossible  beats rock all night with no curfew  my talent's advanced  you haven't a clue  how i do it  the smoothest loopest spare it  if the style fits  i wear it  many attempts were made  none was recognized  45 king said sample soundified  i'm going to wonderland to check  find out who's next  you pretty good  but not quite a legend yet  studio mixer  i got the formula  and said the man from self  i'm warning you  it's my domain  just ask my chauffeur  my ride's equipped everything from a pool to a sofa  on top  it's a usual act  can't wait to get down to 45 studios  i'm into rap  but no urge to sing  i'm dj mark  45  45 king of swing it's a fact i'll attest to  mess around and i'll arrest you  i ain't playing  you know what i'm saying?  this ain't the best you've ever hear coming from a female mc  but you know what i mean?  hail to the queen!   this mc stands for "microphone commando"  when i command that you take a hand  and throw it up in the air  yeah  just like that now  chill  and watch me rap cause i'm flowing  flowing   just like water i slaughter  slaughter   a battle  put me in it  i win it  the mission is music and rhythm  rhythm backed by words  all in my system  system by techniques  techniques i got my heart in  heart into the music  music i take part in  one try  one god  and one destiny  just dance for me  "dance to the music"  repeat 2x   now understand that you must  dance  because this is a beat to clap to  my brother lance said "latifah you got to make them get up off their feet"  so i put my rhyme to a dj mark beat  ample samples  this for example  are made by the 45 king  so cancel  your plans of moving to the front lines  he's a dj  producer  and mind you a friend of mine  i hop  dip  and spend with the children  so get down with the sound and you will lend  to let me bring while i bring  queen latifah to the 45 king  creating  a new style in the name of the flavor unit  that's the way we like it  so i'm doing it  so if you want to know what the plan is to be  i order you to dance for me  "dance to the music"  repeat 2x   my voice is your choice at a stage show  i do it for the flavor unit to make you say "ho"  with powerful lyrics i'm armed  to let a sucker step up and get bombed  by a beat created by my producer  to break you out of the stuff that you're used to  this here is a moment of truth  so take the record to the dj booth  and let's start this  let the beat get dumb  cause i'm a shake it all night and then some  people dancing  i can spot 'em  when i take control  you know i got 'em  stop the music? that's not a question  the flavor unit takes no suggestions  if you're not on the dance tip  here's your chance to be  i order you to dance for me  "dance to the music"  repeat 6x  you asked i came so behold the queen  let's add a little sense to the scene  i'm living positive not out here knocked up  but the lines are so dangerous i ought to be locked up    this rhyme doesn't require prime time  i'm just sharing thoughts of mine  back again cause i knew you wanted it  from the latifah with the queen in front of it    dropping bombs you're up in arms  you're puzzled  the lines will flow like fluid while you guzzle  the sip i drop you on a bdp-produced track  from krs to be exact    it's a flavor unit quest that today has me speaking  cause it's knowledge i'm seeking  enough about myself  i think it's time that i tell you  about the evil that men do    situations  reality  what a concept!  nothing ever seems to stay in step  so today  here is a message to my sisters and brothers  here are some things i want to cover    a woman strives for a better life  but who the hell cares?  because she's living on welfare  the government can't come up with a decent housing plan  so she's in no man's land  it's a sucker who tells you you're equal    krs-one: you don't need him  johannasburg's crying for freedom!    queen latifah: we the people hold these truths to be self-evident    [krs-one]  but there's no response from the president    queen latifah:  someone's living the good life  tax-free  except for a girl  can't find a way to be crack free  and that's just part of the message  i thought i had to send you about the evil that men do    tell me  don't you think it's a shame?  when someone can put a quarter in a video game  but when a homeless person approaches you on the street  you can't treat him the same    it's time to teach the def  the dumb  the blind  that black-on-black crime only shackles and binds  you to a doom  a fate worse than death  but there's still time left    stop putting your conscience on cease  and bring about some type of peace  not only in your heart  but also in your mind  it will benefit all mankind  then there will be one thing that will never stop  and it's the evil that men do the ladies will kick it the rhyme that is wicked  those that don't know how to be pros get evicted  a woman can bear you break you take you  now it's time to rhyme can you relate to  a sister dope enough to make you holler and scream    ayo let me take it from here queen  excuse me but i think i'm about do  to get into precisely what i am about to do  i'm conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue  so listen very carefully as i break it down for you  merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed  pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed  slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes  let me state the position: ladies first  yes?  yes      yeah  there's going to be some changes in here     believe me when i say being a woman is great  you see  i know all the fellas out there will agree with me  not for being one but for being with one  because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some  strong  stepping  strutting  moving on  rhyming  cutting  and not forgetting  we are the ones that give birth  to the new generation of prophets because it's ladies first    i break into a lyrical freestyle  grab the mic  look into the crowd and see smiles  cause they see a woman standing up on her own two  sloppy slouching is something i won't do  some think that we can't flow  can't flow   stereotypes  they got to go  got to go   i'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse   with what?  with a little touch of "ladies first"    who said the ladies couldn't make it  you must be blind  if you don't believe  well here  listen to this rhyme  ladies first  there's no time to rehearse  i'm divine and my mind expands throughout the universe  a female rapper with the message to send the  queen latifah is a perfect specimen    my sister  can i get some?    sure  monie love  grab the mic and get dumb    yo  praise me not for simply being what i am  born in l-o-n-d-o-n and sound american  you dig exactly where i'm coming from  you want righteous rhyming  imma give you some  to enable you to aid yourself and get paid  and the material that has no meaning i wish to slay  pay me every bit of your attention  like mother  like daughter  i would also like to mention  i wish for you to bring me to  bring me to the rhythm  of which is now systematically given  desperately stressing i'm the daughter of a sister  who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another  plus one more  all four  have a job to do  we doing it  respect due  to the mother who's the root of it  and next up is me  the m-o-n-i-e l-o-v-e  and i'm first cause i'm a l-a-d-i-e    contact and in fact  the style  it gets harder  cooling on the scene with my european partner  laying down track after track  waiting for the climax  when i get there  that's when i tax  the next man  or the next woman  it doesn't make a difference  keep the competition coming  and i'll recite the chapter in verse  the title of this recital is "ladies first" alright listen

in secret lined in chalk  see i've been lost ever since i could walk  looking for my daddy and anyone of mamma's boyfriends who would talk  or listen to me when i spoke instead of looking at me like a joke  leaving me behind leaving me to cry when you treated my momma like a ho  but i learned quick that my daddy wasn't ever gonna come around  and i didn't give a shit 'cause me and my momma we held it down  no new kicks first day of school i'm goodwill bound  but when you come from the trench that's how you learn to walk around  so i don't give a fuck if you ever lay eyes on top of my new shoes homey  i just wanted you to know i didn't need a dollar from you i got 'em myself  so if you find yourself in the middle of the floor with the bottle drinkingyourself lonely  then you can keep company with the picture of me in the magazine on the shelfturn the page      daddy can you see me? i'm putting on a show  in the magazines  hear me on the radio  so what do you think huh?   well i hope that

    yeah mamma you look great  perfect  be safe on your first date  for certain  if he brings you home too late  i'll hurt him  don't worry bout me i'm safe i'll close the curtains  and i feel like i'm raising you but what do i know baby blue  all i know is that i was made in you so i put all my faith in you  yeah i was only ten but i felt like a man and i had to let you go  all i wanted was for us to be rich tear drops in my cereal bowl  so i turned into an asshole young and dumb smoking weed  vandalizing  robbing houses  stealing cars  that was me  but everything i did i had to see  feel the pain  had to grieve  to become who i am and i'm proud of the man i came to be  what i've learned cannot be taught  what i've earned cannot be bought  justified deserve it all  so don't be concerned it's not your fault  i never counted sheep i count my blessings  so if you see him now momma don't give him the cold shoulder just give him mymessage just tell him     aye boo get these
