this guy closing your front door  had the feeling of emptiness like i never had before  and i closed my eyes  will you leave me girl    then i realized  it's a crazy world  as he disapeared in his car  i was stunned and i didn't know what to do  everything i had ever dreamed    everything in my life's part of you  and i just couldn't move my feet  so i stood on the pavement as you came out  you acted as you didn't know what it was all about    and i closed my eyes  will you leave me girl  then i realized  it's a crazy world  baby  how could you do it  you just told me lies    and you meet behind my back  with other guys  baby  how could you tell me  there was only me    i was stupid to believe you  i was blind but now i see  then you smiled and you took my hand  "there is something"  you said  "that you may not know    there's a couple of men in my life  and one of them is my brother joe  he's been gone for a long  long time  but he's back and i think he's gonna stay    you'll be seeing a lot of him  he's so nice in every way"  then i closed my eyes  never leave me girl  then i realized  it's a crazy world  so i closed my eyes  never leave me girl    then i realized  it's a crazy world  so i closed my eyes  never leave me girl  then i realized  it's a crazy world i can hear how you work  practising hard  playing night and day  wo-oh  and it sounds better now  yes you

to yourself and softly strumming your guitar  i could hear the distant drums  and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar    they were closer now fernando  every hour every minute seemed to last eternally  i was so afraid fernando  we were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  and i'm not ashamed to say  the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry    there was something in the air that night  the stars were bright  fernando  they were shining there for you and me  for liberty  fernando  though i never thought that we could lose  there's no regret  if i had to do the same again  i would  my friend  fernando  if i had to do the same again  i would  my friend  fernando    now we're old and grey fernando  and since many years i haven't seen a rifle in your hand  can you hear the drums fernando?  do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the rio grande?  i can see it in your eyes  how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land     repeat x2   there was something in the air that night  the stars were bright  fernando  they were shining there for you and me  for liberty  fernando  though i never thought that we could lose  there's no regret  if i had to do the same again  i would  my friend  fernando    yes  if i had to do the same again  i would  my friend  fernando... half past twelve  and i'm watching the late show in my flat all alone  how

that no one believed you  but then again you were lost from the start  now we must suffer and sell our secrets  bargain  playing smart  aching in our hearts    sorry cassandra i misunderstood  now the last day is dawning  some of us wanted but none of us would  listen to words of warning  but on the darkest of nights  nobody knew how to fight  and we were caught in our sleep  sorry cassandra i didn't believe  you really had the power  i only saw it as dreams you would weave  until the final hour    so in the morning your ship will be sailing  now that your father and sister are gone  there is no reason for you to linger  you're grieving deeply but still moving on    you know the future is casting a shadow  no one else sees it but you know your fate  packing your bags  being slow and thorough  knowing  though you're late  that ship is sure to wait    sorry cassandra i misunderstood  now the last day is dawning  some of us wanted but none of us would  listen to words of warning  but on the darkest of nights  nobody knew how to fight  and we were caught in our sleep  sorry cassandra i didn't believe  you really had the power  i only saw it as dreams you would weave  until the final hour    i watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  she stood on deck  just a tiny figure  rigid and restrained  blue eyes filled with pain    sorry cassandra i misunderstood  now the last day is dawning  some of us wanted but none of us would  listen to words of warning  but on the darkest of nights  nobody knew how to fight  and we were caught in our sleep  sorry cassandra i didn't believe  you really had the power  i only saw it as dreams you would weave  until the final hour    i'm sorry cassandra  i'm sorry cassandra twinkle  twinkle little star  how i wonder what you are  like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky  seems to me you shine your light  down to me to say goodnight  twinkle  twinkle my old friend  sleep is waiting round the bend  while you travel through the milky way  from afar  twinkle  twinkle  twinkle little star.    raindrops on a window pane  stillness of a summer rain  silently the haze drifts through the trees  slowly dawn is breaking through  yet a morning without you    curtins rustling in the breeze  i'm still trapped within my dreams  daylight makes it's way into my mind  coming through  yet another morning without you.    finally when darkness falls  casting shadows on the walls  in the twilight hour i am alone  sitting near the fireplace  dying embers warm my face  in this peaceful solitude  all the outside world subdued  everything comes backs to me again  in the gloom  like an angel passing through my room    mmm  mmm  mmm- echoes of a voice i knew    half awake in half in dreams  seeing long forgotten scenes  so the present runs into the past  now and then become entwined  playing games within my mind  like the embers as they die  love was one prolonged goodbye  and it all comes back to me tonight  in the gloom  like an angel passing through my room.    i close my eyes  and my twilight images go by  all too soon  like an angel passing through my room    long awaited darkness falls  casting shadows on the walls  in the twilight hour i am alone  sitting near the fireplace  dying embers warms my face  in this peaceful solitude  all the outside world subdued  everything comes back to me again  in the gloom  like an angel passing through my room    half awake and half in dreams  seeing long forgotten scenes  so the present runs into the past  now and then become entwined  playing games within my mind  like the embers as they die  love was one prolonged goodbye  and it all comes back to me tonight  in the gloom  like an angel passing through my room    i close my eyes  and my twilight images go by  all too soon  like an angel passing through my room. no more champagne  and the fireworks are through  here we are  me and you  feeling lost and feeling blue  it's the end of the party  and the morning seems so grey  so unlike yesterday  now's the time for us to say    happy new year  happy new year  may we all have a vision now and then  of a world where every neighbor is a friend  happy new year  happy new year  may we all have our hopes  our will to try  if we don't we might as well lay down and die  you and i    sometimes i see  how the brave new world arrives  and i see how it thrives  in the ashes of our lives  oh yes  man is a fool  and he thinks he'll be okay  dragging on  feet of clay  never knowing he's astray  keeps on going anyway    happy new year  happy new year  may we all have a vision now and then  of a world where every neighbor is a friend  happy new year  happy new year  may we all have our hopes  our will to try  if we don't we might as well lay down and die  you and i    seems to me now  that the dreams we had before  are all dead  nothing more  than confetti on the floor  it's the end of a decade  in another ten years time  who can say what we'll find  what lies waiting down the line  in the end of eighty-nine    happy new year  happy new year  may we all have a vision now and then  of a world where every neighbor is a friend  happy new year  happy new year  may we all have our hopes  our will to try  if we don't we might as well lay down and die  you and i i have a very good friend  the kind of girl who likes to follow a trend  she has a personal style  some people love it others tend to go wild  you hear her voice everywhere  taking the chair  she's a leading lady  and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going    head over heels  breaking her way  pushing through unknown jungles every day  she's a girl with a taste for the world   the world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing   head over heels  setting the pace  running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  she's extreme if you know what i mean    her man is one i admire  he's so courageous but he's constantly tired  each time when he speaks his mind  she pats his head and says that's all very fine  exert that will of your own  when you're alone  now we better hurry  and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going    head over heels  breaking her way  pushing through unknown jungles every day  she's a girl with a taste for the world   the world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing   head over heels  setting the pace  running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  she's extreme if you know what i mean    you hear her voice everywhere  taking the chair  she's a leading lady  and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going    head over heels  breaking her way  pushing through unknown jungles every day  she's a girl with a taste for the world   the world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing   head over heels  setting the pace  running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  she's extreme if you know what i mean   she's just one of those who always has to do whatever she please   and she goes  head over heels i am the city  you let me be  i am the city    coming through a cloud you're looking at me from above  and i'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes  and you find me beautiful and irresistible  a kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  and you feel a strange attraction  the air is vibrant and electrified  welcome to me here i am  my arms are open wide    somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  there is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  and a million voices blend into a single voice  and you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets  people come and take their chances  sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot  come make your own contribution to this melting pot    i'm the street you walk  the language you talk  i am the city  the skyline is me and the energy  i am the city  the famous hotels and the cocktail bars  and the funny smells  and the turmoil  the cars and the people  the air that you're breathing is me  yes i am the city  you let me be    people feed me with their lives i have a hungry soul  and they all worship me and pay their homage day and night  every day i knew a lot of tired shopping feet  but come the night they will be dancing in the neon light  dazzled by the crazy magic  they're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf  and in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh    i'm the street you walk  the language you talk  i am the city  the skyline is me and the energy  i am the city  the famous hotels and the cocktail bars  and the funny smells  and the turmoil  the cars and the people  the parks and the squares that you see  all the sounds that you hear  and the air that you're breathing is me  yes i am the city  you let me be    i am the city  you let me be  i am the city    the famous hotels and the cocktail bars  and the funny smells  and the turmoil the cars and the people  the air that you're breathing is me    coming through a cloud  you're looking at me from above  and i'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes    i'm the street you walk  the language you talk  i am the city  yes i am the city  you let me be    and you find me beautiful and irresistible  a kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size    the skyline is me and the energy  i am the city  you let me be    somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  there is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats    somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  there is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats    and a million voices blend into a single voice  and you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets    the skyline is me and the energy  i am the city  you let me be    somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  there is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats    somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  there is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats i'm hearing images  i'm seeing songs  no poet has ever painted  voices call out to me  straight to my heart  so strange  yet we're so well acquainted  i let the music speak with no restrains  i let my feelings take over  carry my soul away  into the world  where beauty meets the darkness of the day    where my mind is like an open window  where the high and healing winds blow  from my shallow sleep the sounds awake me  i let them take me    let it be a joke  let it be a smile  let it be a farce  if it makes me laugh for a little while  let it be a tear  let it be a sigh  coming from a heart  speaking to a heart  let it be a cry    some streets are emptiness  dry leaves of autumn  rustling down an old alley  and in the dead of night  i find myself a blind man  in some ancient valley  i let the music speak  leading me gently  urging me like a lover  leading me all the way  into a place  where beauty will defeat the darkest day    where i'm one with every grand illusion  no disturbance  no intrusion  where i let the wistful sounds seduce me  i let them use me    let it be a joke  let it be a smile  let it be a farce  if it makes me laugh for a little while  let it be a tear  let it be a sigh  coming from a heart  speaking to a heart  let it be a cry    let it be a tear  let it be a sigh  coming from a heart  speaking to a heart  let it be a cry    let it be the joy of each new sunrise  or the moment when a day dies  i surrender without reservation  no explanation  no questions why  i take it to me and let it flow through me  yes  i let the music speak  i let the music speak sometimes when i'm mad  there's a part of me that seems to be a little sad  sometimes when i scream  there's a voice in me that says  "you shouldn't be so mean"  oh no  oh no  part of me is acting while the other stands beside  yes  i am to myself what jekyll must have been to hyde    we're like sun and rainy weather  sometimes we're a hit together  me and i  gloomy moods and inspiration  we're a funny combination  me and i  i don't think i'm different or in any way unique  think about yourself for a minute  and you'll find the answer in it  everyone's a freak    sometimes i have toyed  with ideas that i got from good old dr

like sun and rainy weather  sometimes we're a hit together  me and i  gloomy moods and inspiration  we're a funny combination  me and i i was at a party  and this feller said to me  something bad is happening  i'm sure you do agree  people care for nothing  no respect for human rights  evil times are coming  we are in for darker nights?  i said who are you  to talk about impending doom?  he got kinda wary  as he looked around the room  he said  i'm a minister  a big shot in the state?  i said i just can't  believe it  boy  i think it's great  brother can you tell me  what is right and what is wrong?  he said  keep on rocking baby  'til the night is gone?    on and on and on  keep on rocking baby  'til the night is gone    over in the corner  i could see this other guy  he was kinda flirty  he was giving me the eye  so i took advantage  of the fact that i'm a star  shook my hair and took  a casual stroll up to the bar  and as sure as hell  this guy was coming up to me  he said  who am i and  who are you and who are we  what's our situation do  we have some time for us?  i said  i was not exactly  waiting for the bus  he said  if you're going  somewhere can i come along?  i said  keep on rocking baby  'til the night is gone?    on and on and on  keep on rocking baby  'til the night is gone they passed me by  all of those great romances  you were  i felt  robbing me of my rightful chances  my picture clear  everything seemed so easy  and so i dealt you the blow  one of us had to go  now it's different  i want you to know    one of us is crying  one of us is lying  in her lonely bed  staring at the ceiling  wishing she was somewhere else instead  one of us is lonely  one of us is only  waiting for a call  sorry for herself  feeling stupid feeling small  wishing she had never left at all    i saw myself as a concealed attraction  i felt you kept me away from the heat and the action  just like a child  stubborn and misconceiving  that's how i started the show  one of us had to go  now i've changed and i want you to know    one of us is crying  one of us is lying  in her lonely bed  staring at the ceiling  wishing she was somewhere else instead  one of us is lonely  one of us is only  waiting for a call  sorry for herself  feeling stupid feeling small  wishing she had never left at all  never left at all    staring at the ceiling  wishing she was somewhere else instead  one of us is lonely  one of us is only  waiting for a call   the summer air was soft and warm  the feeling right  the paris night  did it's best to please us  and strolling down the elysee  we had a drink in each cafe  and you  you talked of politics  philosophy and i  smiled like mona lisa  we had our chance  it was a fine and true romance    i can still recall our last summer  i still see it all  walks along the seine  laughing in the rain  our last summer  memories that remain    we made our way along the river  and we sat down in the grass  by the eiffel tower  i was so happy we had met  it was the age of no regret  oh yes  those crazy years  that was the time  of the flower-power  but underneath we had a fear of flying  of getting old  a fear of slowly dying  we took the chance  like we were dancing our last dance    i can still recall our last summer  i still see it all  in the tourist jam  round the notre dame  our last summer  walking hand in hand    paris restaurants  our last summer  morning croissants  living for the day  worries far away  our last summer  we could laugh and play    and now you're working in a bank  the family man  the football fan  and your name is harry  how dull it seems  are you the hero of my dreams    i can still recall our last summer  i still see it all  walks along the seine  laughing in the rain  our last summer  memories that remain  i can still recall our last summer  i still see it all  in the tourist jam  round the notre dame  our last summer  walking hand in hand  paris restaurants  our last summer  morning croissants  living for the day  worries far away... schoolbag in hand  she leaves home in the early morning  waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile  i watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness  and i have to sit down for a while  the feeling that i'm losing her forever  and without really entering her world  i'm glad whenever i can share her laughter  that funny little girl    slipping through my fingers all the time  i try to capture every minute  the feeling in it    slipping through my fingers all the time  do i really see what's in her mind  each time i think i'm close to knowing  she keeps on growing  slipping through my fingers all the time    sleep in our eyes  her and me at the breakfast table  barely awake i let precious time go by  then when she's gone  there's that odd melancholy feeling  and a sense of guilt i can't deny  what happened to the wonderful adventures  the places i had planned for us to go  well  some of that we did  but most we didn't  and why  i just don't know    slipping through my fingers all the time  i try to capture every minute  the feeling in it    slipping through my fingers all the time  do i really see what's in her mind  each time i think i'm close to knowing  she keeps on growing  slipping through my fingers all the time    sometimes i wish that i could freeze the picture  and save it from the funny tricks of time   slipping through my fingers   slipping through my fingers all the time  schoolbag in hand  she leaves home in the early morning  waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile i must have left my house at eight  because i always do  my train  i'm certain  left the station just when it was due  i must have read the morning paper going into town  and having gotten through the editorial  no doubt i must have frowned  i must have made my desk around a quarter after nine  with letters to be read  and heaps of papers waiting to be signed  i must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so  the usual place  the usual bunch  and still on top of this i'm pretty sure it must have rained  the day before you came    i must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two  and at the time i never even noticed i was blue  i must have kept on dragging through the business of the day  without really knowing anything  i hid a part of me away  at five i must have left  there's no exception to the rule  a matter of routine  i've done it ever since i finished school  the train back home again  undoubtedly i must have read the evening paper then  oh yes  i'm sure my life was well within its usual frame  the day before you came    i must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so  and stopped along the way to buy some chinese food to go  i'm sure i had my dinner watching something on tv  there's not  i think  a single episode of dallas that i didn't see  i must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten  i need a lot of sleep  and so i like to be in bed by then  i must have read a while  the latest one by marilyn french or something in that style  it's funny  but i had no sense of living without aim  the day before you came    and turning out the light  i must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night  and rattling on the roof i must have heard the sound of rain  the day before you came they came from the hills  and they came from the valleys and the plains  they struggled in the cold  in the heat and the snow and in the rain  came to hear him play  play their minds away    we're all following a strange melody  we're all summoned by a tune  we're following the piper  and we dance beneath the moon  we're following the piper  and we dance beneath the moon for him  and we dance beneath the moon  sub luna saltamus    they came from the south  from the west and the north and from the east  they waited for the man  like a parish is waiting for the priest  longed to hear him play  play their minds away    we're all following a strange melody  we're all summoned by a tune  we're following the piper  and we dance beneath the moon  we're following the piper  and we dance beneath the moon for him  and we dance beneath the moon  sub luna saltamus    he gave them a dream  he seduced everybody in the land  the fire in his eyes  and the fear was a weapon in his hand  so they let him play  play their minds away    we're all following a strange melody  we're all summoned by a tune  we're following the piper  and we dance beneath the moon  we're following the piper  and we dance beneath the moon for him  and we dance beneath the moon    and we dance beneath the moon i hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me  the sound so ominously tearing through the silence  i cannot move  i'm standing  numb and frozen  among the things i love so dearly  the books  the paintings and the furniture  help me    the signal's sounding once again and someone tries the door-knob  none of my friends would be so stupidly impatient  and they don't dare to come here  anymore now  but how i loved our secret meetings  we talked and talked in quiet voices  smiling    now i hear them moving  muffled noises coming through the door  i feel i'm  crackin' up  voices growing louder  irritation building  and i'm close to fainting  crackin' up  they must know by now i'm in here trembling  in a terror evergrowing  crackin' up  my whole world is falling  going crazy  there is no escaping now  i'm  crackin' up    these walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation  and seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces  and now they've come to take me  come to break me  and yet it isn't unexpected  i have been waiting for these visitors  help me    now i hear them moving  muffled noises coming through the door  i feel i'm  crackin' up  voices growing louder  irritation building  and i'm close to fainting  crackin' up  they must know by now i'm in here trembling  in a terror evergrowing  crackin' up  my whole world is falling  going crazy  there is no escaping now  i'm  crackin' up    now i hear them moving  muffled noises coming through the door  i feel i'm  crackin' up  voices growing louder  irritation building  and i'm close to fainting    crackin' up  i have been waiting for these visitors   they must know by now i'm in here trembling  in a terror evergrowing    crackin' up  i have been waiting for these visitors   my whole world is falling  going crazy  there is no escaping now  i'm    crackin' up  i have been waiting for these visitors   now i hear them moving  muffled noises coming through the door  i feel i'm    crackin' up  i have been waiting for these visitors   voices growing louder  irritation building  and i'm close to fainting    crackin' up  i have been waiting for these visitors   they must know by now i'm in here trembling  in a terror ever growing    crackin' up  i have been waiting for these visitors   my whole world is falling  going crazy  there is no escaping now  i'm  crackin' up i don't want to talk  about the things we've gone through  though it's hurting me  now it's history  i've played all my cards  and that's what you've done too  nothing more to say  no more ace to play    the winner takes it all  the loser standing small  beside the victory  that's my destiny    i was in your arms  thinking i belonged there  i figured it made sense  building me a fence  building me a home  thinking i'd be strong there  but i was a fool  playing by the rules    the gods may throw a dice  their minds as cold as ice  and someone way down here  loses someone dear  the winner takes it all  the loser has to fall  it's simple and it's plain  why should i complain.    but tell me does she kiss  like i used to kiss you?  does it feel the same  when she calls your name?  somewhere deep inside  you must know i miss you  but what can i say  rules must be obeyed    the judges will decide  the likes of me abide  spectators of the show  always staying low  the game is on again  a lover or a friend  a big thing or a small  the winner takes it all    i don't want to talk  if it makes you feel sad  and i understand  you've come to shake my hand  i apologize  if it makes you feel bad  seeing me so tense  no self-confidence  but you see  the winner takes it all  the winner takes it all he had what you might call a trivial occupation  he cleaned the platforms of the local railway station  with no romance in his life  sometimes he wished he had a wife  he read the matrimonial advertising pages  the cries for help from different people  different ages  but they had nothing to say  at least not until the day  when something special he read  this is what it said    if you dream of the girl for you  then call us and get two for the price of one  we're the answer if you feel blue  so call us and get two for the price of one  if you dream of the girl for you  then call us and get two for the price of one  we're the answer if you feel blue  so call us and get two for the price of one    he called the number and a voice said: "alice whiting"  the voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting  he was amazed at his luck  the purest streak of gold he'd struck  he said: "i read your ad  it sounded rather thrilling  i think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling  why don't we meet for a chat  the three of us in my flat"  i can't forget what i read  this is what it said    if you dream of the girl for you  then call us and get two for the price of one  we're the answer if you feel blue  so call us and get two for the price of one  if you dream of the girl for you  then call us and get two for the price of one  we're the answer if you feel blue  so call us and get two for the price of one    she said: "i'm sure we must be perfect for each other  and if you doubt it  you'll be certain when you meet my mother" don't know how to take it  don't know where to go  my resistance running low  and every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so   you know that i'm nobody's fool   i'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me  i don't have a strategy  it's just like taking candy from a baby and i think i must be    under attack  i'm being taken  about to crack  defenses breaking  won't somebody please have a heart  come and rescue now 'cause i'm falling apart  under attack  i'm taking cover  he's on my track  my chasing lover  thinking nothing can stop him now  but i want to know  should i want to  i'm not sure    this is getting crazy  i should tell him so  really let my anger show  persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite "no"   i'm kind of certain that's the truth   guess i'm kind of flattered but i'm scared as well  something like a magic spell  i hardly dare to think of what could happen  where i'd be if i fell    under attack  i'm being taken  about to crack  defenses breaking  won't somebody please have a heart  come and rescue now 'cause i'm falling apart  under attack  i'm taking cover  he's on my track  my chasing lover  thinking nothing can stop him now  should i want to  i'm not sure  i would know how    under attack  i'm being taken  about to crack  defenses breaking  won't somebody please have a heart  come and rescue now 'cause i'm falling apart  under attack  i'm taking cover  he's on my track  my chasing lover  thinking nothing can stop him now  should i want to  i'm not sure  i would know

forever excusing your intentions  that i give in to my pretendings  which forgive you each time  without me knowing  they melt my heart to stone      and i hear your words that i made up  you say my name like there could be an us  i best tidy up my head i'm the only one in love  i'm the only one in love    each and every time i turn around to leave  i feel my heart begin to burst and bleed  so desperately i try to link it with my head  but instead i fall back to my knees  as you tear your way right through me  i forgive you once again  without me knowing  you've burnt my heart to stone    and i hear your words that i made up  you say my name like there could be an us  i best tidy up my head i'm the only one in love  i'm the only one in love    why do you steal my hand  whenever i'm standing my own ground  you build me up  then leave me dead    i hear your words you made up  i say your name like there should be an us  i best tidy up my head i'm the only one  in love  i'm the only one in love wait  do you see my heart on my sleeve?  it's been there for days on end and  it's been waiting for you to open up  yours too baby  come on now  i'm trying to tell you just how  i'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally  say that it's always been me      that's made you feel the way you've never felt before  and i'm all you need and that you never want more  then you'd say all of the right things without a clue  but you'd save the best for last  like i'm the one for you    you should know that you're just a temporary fix  this is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me  oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free  how dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me    why is it every time i think i've tried my hardest  it turns out it ain't enough  you're still not mentioning love  what am i supposed to do to make you want me properly?  i'm taking these chances and getting nowhere  and though i'm trying my hardest you go back to her  and i think that i know things may never change  i'm still hoping one day i might hear you say    i make you feel the way you've never felt before  and i'm all you need and that you never want more  then you'd say all of the right things without a clue  but you'd save the best for last  like i'm the one for you    you should know that you're just a temporary fix  this is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me  oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free  how dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me    but  despite the truth that i know  i find it hard to let go and give up on you  seems i love the things you do  like the meaner you treat me the more eager i am  to persist with this heartbreak and running around  and i will do until i'm finding myself you    and make you feel a way you've never felt before  and be all you need so that you never want more  and you'll say all of the right things without a clue  and you'll be the one for me and me the one for you i've made up my mind   don't need to think it over   if i'm wrong i am right   don't need to look no further   this ain't lust   i know this is love but     if i tell the world   i'll never say enough   cause it was not said to you   and that's exactly what i need to do   if i'm in love with you     should i give up   or should i just keep chasing pavements?  even if it leads nowhere   or would it be a waste?  even if i knew my place should i leave it there?  should i give up   or should i just keep chasing pavements?  even if it leads nowhere    i'd build myself up   and fly around in circles   waiting as my heart drops   and my back begins to tingle  finally could this be it or    should i give up   or should i just keep chasing pavements?  even if it leads nowhere   or would it be a waste?  even if i knew my place should i leave it there?  should i give up   or should i just keep chasing pavements?  even if it leads nowhere yeah    should i give up   or should i just keep chasing pavements?  even if  it leads nowhere   or would it be a waste?  even if i knew my place should i leave it there?  should i give up   or should i just keep on chasing pavements?  should i just keep on chasing pavements? or    should i give up   or should i just keep chasing pavements?  even if it leads nowhere   or would it be a waste?  even if i knew my place should i leave it there?  should i give up   or should i just keep chasing pavements?  even if it leads nowhere you say it's all in my head  and the things i think just don't make sense  so where you been then? don't go all coy  don't turn it round on me like it's my fault  see i can see that look in your eyes  the one that shoots me each and every time    you grace me with your cold shoulder  whenever you look at me i wish i was her  you shower me with words made of knives  whenever you look at me i wish i was her    these days when i see you  you make it look like i'm see-through  do tell me why you waste our time  when your heart ain't in it  and you're not satisfied  you know i know just how you feel  i'm starting to find myself feeling that way too    when you grace me with your cold shoulder  whenever you look at me i wish i was her  you shower me with words made of knives  whenever you look at me i wish i was her    time and time again  i play the role of fool   just for you   even in the daylight when you think that   i don't see you   try to look for things i hear but our eyes never find  though i do know how you play    you grace me with your cold shoulder  whenever you look at me i wish i was her  you shower me with words made of knives  whenever you look at me i wish i was her    you grace me with your cold shoulder  whenever you look at me i wish i was her  you shower me with words made of knives  whenever you look at me i wish i was her this is how the story went  i met someone by accident  it blew me away  it blew me away    it was in the darkest of my days  when you took my sorrow and you took my pain  and buried them away  you buried them away    i wish i could lay down beside you  when the day is done  and wake up to your face against the morning sun  but like everything i've ever known  you disappear one day  so i spend my whole life hiding my heart away    drop you off at the train station  put a kiss on top of your head  watch you wave  watched you wave    then i went on home to your skyscrapers  neon lights and waiting papers  that you call home  i call it home    i wish i could lay down beside you  when the day is done  and wake up to your face against the morning sun  but like everything i've ever known  you disappear one day  so i spend my whole life hiding my heart away    i woke up feeling heavy hearted  i'm going back to where i started  the morning rain  the morning rain  although i wish that you were here  that same old road that brought me here  is calling me home  it's calling me home    i wish i could lay down beside you  when the day is done  and wake up to your face against the morning sun  but like everything i've ever known  you disappear one day  so i spend my whole life hiding my heart away  and i can spend my whole life hiding my heart away you said i'm stubborn and i never give in  i think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening  you say i'm selfish  i agree with you on that  i think you're giving out in way too much in fact  i say we've only known each other a year  you say i've known you longer my dear  you like to be so close  i like to be alone  i like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor  walking with each other   think we'll never match at all  but we do  but we do  but we do  but we do    i thought i knew myself  somehow you know me more  i've never known this  never before  you're the first to make up whenever we argue  i don't know who i'd be if i didn't know you  you're so provocative  i'm so conservative  you're so adventurous  i'm so very cautious  combining  you think we would and we do   but we do  but we do  but we do    favoritism ain't my thing but   in this situation i'll be glad    favoritism ain't my thing but   in this situation i'll be glad to make an exception    you said i'm stubborn and i never give in  i think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening  you say i'm selfish  i agree with you on that  i think you're giving out in way too much

tell you   i know i wanna tell you    i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna be there to catch you from falling    cold as the arctic ice  hot as a passion's rise  these are the days i spend alone  pure as an infant's heart  that beats through the light and dark  these are the pictures of you  always getting closer  i wanna hold you closer    i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna be there when love starts calling    i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna be there to catch you from falling    i only wish my heart  could fly like it does  when i sit and dream  i'll never wake again  as i hold you tenderly  my thoughts were real  and being with you now is the only  thought that's strong   it's a lonely night  and i'm trying  to hold on...    i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna be there when love starts calling    i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna hold you tonight  i wanna be there to catch you from falling     i know you're leaving  i won't ask you to stay  i won't hold you back  i won't stand in your way  if that's what you've gotta do  i understand  it's not that easy setting you free  but that's how it's gotta be  and as you're walking away  as i'm watching you go  there's one thing i want you to know  just remember my heart's with you  when the night gets so long and cold  and no ones there to hold and you're all alone  take a moment to think of me  and

think of me  and the love that we used to know  and if you ever find that you're all alone   it happened long ago  when i felt the need  for a life of my own  i dreampt of summer love  and moving high up north  but no one would go  so i walked up the hill and lay there  imagining the day was near  i know i want to stay there  and be a great pioneer    i made a promise then  that i'd find a place  where my world won't end  give me a piece of land  that will be my life  that i will defend  if i work really hard  i will surely survive  i know my virtue is strong  no one could oppose a spirit so raw  to be a part of the state  to be known as a great pioneer  i keep the fires burning  to let you know i'm free  my heart will always be yearning    to be  a part of the state  to be  a part of the state  to be  known as a great pioneer    and if it all should end  and i hear the call  from the great unknown  i'll need to go my way  let me have my day  let me be alone    i was dreaming here and lay there  knowing that my time is here  i know i wanna stay there    to be  a part of the state  to be  a part of the state  to be  known as a great pioneer     i realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice  and it don't count for much  but i'm not letting go  i believe there's still much to believe in    so lift your eyes if you feel you can  reach for a star and i'll show you a plan  i figured it out  what i needed was someone to show me    you know you can't fool me  i've been loving you too long  it started so easy  you want to carry on      lost in love and i don't know much  was i thinking aloud and fell out of touch?  but i'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted    so lift your eyes if you feel you can  reach for a star and i'll show you a plan  i figured it out  what i needed was someone to show me    you know you can't fool me  i've been loving you too long  it started so easy  you want to carry on        you know you can't fool me  i've been loving you too

way    then you smiled and i reached out to you  i could tell you were lonely too  one look and then it all began for you and me  the moment that we touched i knew that there would be    two less lonely people in the world  and it's gonna be fine  out of all the people in the world  i just can't believe you're mine  in my life where everything was wrong  something finally went right  now

of a good rhyme  while drinking all they wanted to.  a bitter sweet  this final evening   before he must leave her side...    they danced around the glass filled tables  while fiddlers played so sweet and low.  their eyes hard fixed upon each other   however would she let him go?  and when the time it came upon them   she said in case we forget...    just a little bit more  just a little bit more.  just a little bit more  just a little bit more.  just a little bit more  just a little bit more.  just a little bit more  just a little bit more.    the letters came and every single sunday  we all would wait to hear the news.  she knew her love would be home someday   the only thing she held on to.  we sang a song just like we used to  and she said before we could leave...    just a little bit more  just a little bit more.  just a little bit more  just a little bit more.  just a little bit more  just a little bit more.  just a little bit more  just a little bit more.    that night she heard her true love calling  with words that only she could know.  they held each other till the morning  and when it was his time to go.  she said...    just a little bit more  just a little bit more.  just a little bit more  just a little bit more.  just a little bit more  just a little bit more.  just a little bit more  just a little bit more.    just a little bit more. i know just how to whisper

of the sun are  streaming through the waves in your hair  and every star in the sky is taking aim at  your eyes like a spotlight  the beating of my heart is a drum  and it's lost  and it's looking for a rhythm like you  you can take the darkness from the pit of the night  and turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright  i've gotta follow it 'cause everything i know  well  it's nothing 'til i give it to you  i can make the runner stumble  i can make the final block  and i can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle  i can make all the stadiums rock  i can make tonight forever  or i can make it disappear by the dawn  and i can make you every promise that has ever been made  and i can make all your demons be gone  but i'm never gonna make it without you  do you really want to see me crawl  and i'm never gonna make it like you do    making love out of nothing at all  out of nothing at all  out of nothing at all  out of nothing at all  out of nothing at all  out of nothing at all

you.  but for now your voice is near enough.  how i miss you  and i miss you love.  and though all the days that pass me by so slow   all the emptiness inside me flows all around   and there's no way out.  i'm just thinkin' so much of you.  there was never any doubt.    i can wait forever if you say you'll be there too.  i can wait forever if you will.  i know it's worth it all to spend my life alone with you.    when it looked as though my life was wrong   you took my love and gave it somewhere to belong.  i'll be here when hope is out of sight.  i just wish that i was next to you tonight.  and oh  i'll be reaching for you even though  you'll be somewhere else  my love.  we'll go like a bird on its way back home.  i could never let you go.  and i just want you to know    i can wait forever if you say you'll be there too.  i can wait forever if you will.  i know it's worth it all to spend my life alone with you.    where are you now   along with the thoughts we share?  keep them strong somehow.  and you know i'll always be there.    i can wait forever if you say you'll be there too.  i can wait forever if you will.  i know it's worth it all to spend my life alone with you.before you go away  to the one you do belong  so glad we met and you stayed  though it wasn't very long  was it only just a dream  it's over now it seems  if there were no goodbyes  would you stay that you still care  i won't believe my eyes  when i see you won't be there  'cause this love so hard to find  now you're leavin' me behind  oh please    chorus:  show me and tell me  how do you put this love aside   and  put it away for another time  with no guarantee that you'll be mine  a fool i am it seems  'cause i'll been lovin' you in my dreams  until i wake up and i find out  that time ain't our friend  i'll just stay a fool till the end     till the end  i'll be a fool    till i find it's me and you   if it only was game  why'd you have to fool my heart  oh girl ain't it a shame  that we promised from the start  that our love was here to stay  for each and everyday  if i had only known  and if i didn't have to care  then being all alone  it wouln't be so hard to bear  this love so hard to find  that we're leavin' here behind  oh please    repeat chorus    i maybe over acting  i know i must stay strong  but you pulled the string too hard  and now we're going on our own    repeat chorus    till the end  you know i just stay a fool i'm so blessed my lord  i can see you  in all the lovely things  so fine and true  i see you in the beauty  of the flowers and the rain  i

listening to the father of lies?  if you are then you're headed for trouble.  listen too long  you'll eventually die.    too late for walking in the middle   too late to try.  and it's too late for sitting in the balance   no more middle line.    are you puzzled by the way that you're behaving?  you wonder why you do the things you do?  are you troubled by your lack of resistance?  it feels like something's got a hold on you.    are you living in an old man's rubble?  listening to the father of lies?  if you are then you're headed for trouble.  if you listen too long  you'll eventually die.

'cause you try to play the part  of a life that you don't know and now it's scaring you?  'cause you're saying all the right words but no one's ever heard  the voice that's crying out inside your heart  saying please don't make me die for you  i've gotta make you see  that there's a part of me i never want to lose  but if i have to die for you somehow let me see  that you're more than words i need a glimpse of you  but it's sunday church again and the habit to pretend  is stronger than you knew  look how it's ruling you  but it's friends you try to blame  oh i've done it just the same  'cause it's easier than answering to him  you think that they're playing games  they leave and never act the same  and you don't want a part of their show  yes you think there's something more  but not inside these holy doors  well what are you looking for?  yes we have to die for him  that's the struggle that you see?  'cause it's the hardest thing you'll ever have to do  but no it's not impossible  he's been waiting so long for you  but don't be afraid 'cause he knows the pain  because he had to do it for you  for you   all my my friends are happy to stay  here in this yard day after day  but something inside me has called me away  i don't understand but i know i can't stay    i'm gonna fly  no one knows where  but i'm gonna fly  i'm lighter than air    cause i have felt for the first time  i can be myself  no more faces to hide behind  just a smile and a dream that's mine  even if i am the only one who wants to fly    i'm gonna fly  no one knows where  but i'm gonna fly  i soar through the air    all of my life seems i've waited  for the time to start  being the person inside of me  unafraid of being me  no more faces to hide behind  just a smile and a dream that's mine  even if i'm the only one who wants to fly    if i had my life to live over again  i'd run bare foot  relax a bit more  and i'd talk to more children  and i'd learn how they laugh  and i'd teach them how i've learned to fly    i'm gonna fly  no one knows where  but i'm gonna fly  i'm lighter than air    i'm gonna fly  no one knows where  but i'm gonna fly  i soar through the air    cause all of my life seems i've waited  for the time to start  being the person inside of me  unafraid of being me  even if i'm the only one who wants to fly  i'm gonna fly shoulder to the wheel  for someone else's selfish gain  here there is no choosing  working the clay  wearing their anger like a ball and chain.    fire in the field  underneath a blazing sun  but soon the sun was faded  and freedom was a song  i heard them singing when the day was done  singing to the holy one.    lead me on  lead me on  to a place where the river runs  into your keeping  oh.    lead me on  lead me on  the awaited deliverance  comforts the seeking  lead on.    waiting for the train  labelled with a golden star  heavy hearted boarding  whispers in the dark  "where are we going--is it very far?"    bitter cold terrain  echoes of a slamming door  in chambers made for sleeping  forever  voices like thunder in a mighty roar  cry to the lord.    lead me on  lead me on  to a place where the river runs  into your keeping  oh.    lead me on  lead me on  the awaited deliverance  comforts the seeking  lead on.    man hurts man  time and time  time again  and we drown in the wake of our power  somebody tell me why.    lead me on  lead me on  to a place where the river runs  into your keeping  oh.    lead me on  lead me on  the awaited deliverance  comforts the seeking  lead on.    lead me on  lead me on  to a place where the river runs  into your keeping  oh.    lead me on  lead me on  the awaited deliverance  comforts the seeking  lead on. in the morning when i wake and my feet can find the floor  i stumble down the hall and i open up the door  then i look into the mirror just like you know you do  stopping for a moment  i can

we see that far?    but like your daddy said  the same sun that melts the wax can harden clay  and the same rain that drowns the rat will grow the hay  and the mighty wind that knocks us down  if we lean into it  will drive our fears away.    and then i woke you in the dead of night  to hold my hands  push away the fright  life had come  how can we see that far?  - a son  how can we see that far?    yeah  we were nervous and a little scared  until the music of our baby's cry  filled the air  how can we see that far?  how can we see that far?     but like your daddy said  the same sun that melts the wax can harden clay  and the same rain that drowns the rat will grow the hay  and the mighty wind that knocks us down  if we lean into it  will drive our fears away.    we might die  we might live  we could hurt each other badly  do things  things so hard to forgive  ooh  and if time is not our friend  your mind might forget me before the end  and oh  i cannot  i cannot look that far.    but like your daddy said   how can we see that far?   the same sun that melts the wax can harden clay  and the same rain that drowns the rat will grow the hay  and the mighty wind that knocks us down  if we lean into it  how can we see that far?  gotta lean into it  will drive our fears away    it's the same sun  yeah  and the same rain  it's the same sun  and the same rain. when every

help us through it  that's what love if for  nothing else can do it.    melt our defenses  bring us back to our senses  give us strength to try once more  baby  that's what love is for.    sometimes i see you  and you don't know i am there  and i'm washed away by emotions  i hold deep down inside  getting stronger with time  it's living through the fire  and holding on we find    that's what love is for  to help us through it  that's what love if for  nothing else can do it.    melt our defenses  bring us back to our senses  give us strength to try once more  baby  that's what love is for.    believing in the one thing  that has gotten us this far  that's what love is for  to help us through it  that's what love if for  nothing else can do it.    round off the edges  talk us down from the ledges  give us strength to try once more  baby  that's what love is for  that's what love if for.    that's what love if for  melt our defenses  bring us back to our senses  give us strength to try

'cause every time i take her out  we always in the vip.  shorty don't know who i am  but she knows me  oh   make her say  ah  make her say  ooh  make her say  ah    'bout me   she's a dream  when you come back i won't be here  she said and gently pulled me near  if you want to talk you can call  i know it's not your fault    i just smiled and said let go of me  but there's something that i've just gotta know  did someone else steal my part?  she said it's not my fault    then my heart did time in siberia  was waiting for the life to come true  'cause it's all so dark and mysterious  when the one you want doesn't want you too    i was drifted in between  like i was on the outside looking in  yeah yeah  in my dreams you are still here  like you've always been    oh yeah  my heart did time in siberia  was waiting for the life to come true  'cause it's all so dark and mysterious  when the one you want doesn't want you too    i gave myself away completely  but you just couldn't see me  though i was sleeping in your bed  'cause someone else was on your mind  in your head    when i came back she wasn't there  just a note left on the stairs  if you want to talk give me a call    my heart did time in siberia  was waiting for the life to come true  'cause it's all so dark and mysterious  when the one you want doesn't want you too  when the one that you want doesn't want you    my heart did time in siberia  was waiting for the life to come true  'cause it's all so dark and mysterious  when the one you want doesn't want you too    siberia  siberia  when the one you want doesn't want you too here we are  seven days  and seven nights of empty tries  it's ritual  habitual  but it's never gonna work this time    we're to the point of no return  and along the way the only thing we've learned  is how to hurt each other    i'm looking back and wondering why  it took so long to realize  that nothing's changed  it never will  all these years of standing still  and still we stay in all this pain  and nothing's gonna make it go away    i don't wanna wait another minute  put me out of my misery  i can read your mind baby you're not in it  and we're not what we used to be  no you wouldn't have to lie to me  if you would only let me go  and i don't wanna wait another minute to hear  something that i already know  i know  i know  i know  something that i already know  i know  i know  i know    so save your voice  don't waste your breath  can't you see we're at the end  and this goodbye is permanent  so wish me well and try to forget    and all the fights  and all the ways  we almost made it  but we never did  and it's finally come to this    i don't wanna wait another minute  put me out of my misery  i can read your mind baby you're not in it  and we're not what we used to be  no you wouldn't have to lie to me  if you would only let me go  and i don't wanna wait another minute to hear  something that i already know    we can not hide what we've become  so sick and tired of being numb  it's done  it's done  it's done    i don't wanna wait another minute  put me out of my misery  i can read your mind baby you're not in it  and we're not what we used to be  no  you wouldn't have to lie to me  if you would only let me go  and i don't wanna wait another minute to hear  something that i already know  i know  i know  i know  something that i already know  i know  i know  i know  something that i already know  'cause i know  i know  i know  'cause i know  'cause i know how come you never know  what you got until it's gone  too bad  because i never felt so good with anyone  how fooled was i into thinking  i was gonna be alright  okay  fine    so every day i try a little harder  to forget her  lie here convince myself  tomorrow will be better    the trouble is i can't get her out of my mind  when i close my eyes at night  who's gonna save me  now she's gone  the trouble is there's a part of me  that still can't let go of her memory  and now i know what it is  love is what the trouble is  love is what the trouble is    how come she said  you never wear your heart  where i can see  too bad  'cause now i'm the one  who's sorry  how stupid was i into thinking  i was gonna be alright  okay  fine  so everyday i find a little something  to remind me  no matter how i try  i can't put the past behind me    the trouble is i can't get her out of my mind  when i close my eyes at night  who's gonna save me  now she's gone  the trouble is there's a part of me  that still can't let go of her memory  and now i know what it is    love has let me go

 children  children will listen nothing is so good it lasts eternally  perfect situations must go wrong  but this has never yet prevented me  wanting far too much for far too long.  looking back i could have played it differently  one of few more moments who can tell  but it took time to understand the man  now at least i know i know him well.  wasn't it good? oh so good  wasn't he fine? oh so fine  isn't it madness he can't be mine?  but in the end he needs  a little bit more than me  more she needs security  he needs his fantasy and freedom  i know him so well.    no one in your life is with you constantly  no one is completely on your side  and though i move my world to be with him  still the gap between us is too wide.    looking back i could have played it differently  could have played things some other way.  learn about the man before i fell  i was just a little careless  but i was ever so much younger then.  i was so much younger then  now at least i know i know him well  wasn't it good? oh so good  wasn't he fine? oh so fine  isn't it madness he won't be mine?  didn't i know how it would go?  if i knew from the start  why am i falling apart?  wasn't he fine? isn't it madness  he won't be mine?  but in the end he needs a little bit more than me  more she needs security  he needs his fantasy and freedom  i know him so well  it took time to understand me  i know him so well. if i didn't love you  i'd be safe from harm.  i would never find myself  lost inside your arms.  if i didn't love you  i'd never feel the pain  of sunny days without you  drowning in the rain.  if i didn't love you    if i didn't love you  peace would rule the day  all the dark and out would surely go away.  if i didn't love you  i wouldn't pay the cost  of living every endless day  if our love is lost.  if i didn't love you  if i didn't love you    and yet you make me breathless  at the way you move  i never knew that i  could ever love the way we do.  i don't know how you reach me  in that place in my heart  belonging to only you.    if i didn't love you  i wouldn't lose control  the danger loving brings a word  never touch my soul.  if i didn't love you  perhaps i wouldn't die.  if you should ever say to me  "i'm sorry  goodbye."  if i didn't love you  how can there be music  in the way you touch?  i can't believe that somehow  i believe in you so much.  now you've come and taught me  how to give you my heart.  and make me feel at last  that the end will never start.  you're the only reason  i'm not afraid to fall.  for if i didn't love you  if i didn't love you  i wouldn't love at all. if i never met you  if i never saw your face  this world  this world would be a colder place  i bet.  if we'd never met...  if i never met you  if i never knew your love  my life  my life might be a sad song of regret.  if we'd never met...  but we said one "hello."  and look at how the world begins to spin  look at how the shadows disappear  now that you are here.  if i never met you  if i never felt your kiss  my days  my nights would not be filled like this  it's true.  i don't know who i'd love  i don't know what i'd do if i never met you.  just look at how the shadows disappear  now that you are here.  if i never met you  if i never felt your kiss  my days  my nights would be filled like this  it's true.  i don't know who i'd love  i don't know what i'd do  if i never met you.  i don't know who i'd love  i don't know what i'd do  if i never met you.  "we must be loving right"  some folks got nothin' but troubles  so little joy in their lives.  but wherever we go  happiness follows.  we must be lovin' right.  it might be the way i adore you.  or the way that you hold me tight.  i don't know the reason  but i'm believin'  we must be lovin' right  all of our friends say  love fades away with time.  but i know they're wrong  'cause they've never known  a love like yours and mine.  so if the whole world goes crazy  let everyone else fuss and fight.  when all's said and done  we'll be the lucky ones.  we must be lovin' right.  some folks got nothin' but troubles.  oh so little joy in their lives.  but wherever we go  happiness follows.  we must be lovin' right.  we must be lovin' right. vince  when i fall  you're my place to land.  i lose my touch  you're my hands   the one i hold on to.  if you run out of reason to try  i'll love enough for both you and i  i'll be the one you can run to.  barbra  i'd rather go through any pain love puts us through  than to spend one day without you by my side.  both  if you ever leave me  will you take me with you?  if you're ever lonely  i want to be lonely too.  my home's beside you  no matter where you may go.  my love's inside you  even more than you know.    barbra  in a world of anger and lies  i find peace in your eyes  a flame in the darkness.    both  ooh  and through all space and time  'til every star refuses to shine    barbra  you know where my heart is.  i'd rather go through any pain love puts us through    both  than to spend one day without you by my side  if you ever leave me  will you take me with you?  if you're ever lonely  i want to be lonely too  woah.  my home's beside you  no matter where you may go.    barbra  where you may go    both  my love's inside you  even more than you know.    and i can't remember life without you  the way it used to be  feels like a million years away.    vince  well hold me 'til the angels sing.    barbra  tell me every little thing.    both  promise me forever from this day    if you ever leave me  will you take me with you?  if you're ever lonely  i want to be lonely too  woah.  my home's beside you  no matter where you may go.    vince  where you may go    both  my love's inside you  even more than you know.    barbra  even more than you know.    vince  even more than you know.    both  even more than you know.  even more than you know. i don't know why i'm frightened  i know my way around here  the cardboard trees  the painted seas  the sound here  yes  a world to rediscover  but i 'm not in any hurry  and i need a moment    the whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways  the atmosphere as thrilling here as always  feel the early morning madness  feel the magic in the making  why  everything's as if we never said goodbye    i've spent so many mornings just trying to resist you  i'm trembling now  you can't know how i've missed you  missed the fairy tale adventure  in this ever spinning playground  we were young together    i'm coming out of make-up  the lights already burning  not long until the cameras will start turning  and the early morning madness  and the magic in the making  yes  everything's as if we never said goodbye    i don't want to be alone  that's all in the past  this world's waited long enough  i've come home at last!    and this time will be bigger  and brighter than we knew it  so watch me fly  we all know i can do it  could i stop my hand from shaking?  has there ever been a moment  with so much to live for?    the whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways  so much to say not just today but always  we'll have early morning madness  we'll have magic in the making  yes  everything's as if we never said goodbye  yes  everything's as if we never said goodbye  we taught the world new ways to dream! think of all the hearts  beating in the world  at the same time  think of all the faces    and the stories they could tell  at the same time  think of all the eyes  looking out into this world    trying to make some sense of what we see  think of all the ways we have of seeing  think of all the ways there are of being  think of all the children    being born into this world  at the same time  feel your love surround them  through the years they'll need to grow    at the same time  just think of all the hands  that will be reaching for a dream  think of all the dreams that could come true    yes if the hands we're reaching with  could come together  joining me and you  when it comes to thinking of tomorrow    we must protect our fragile destiny  in this prescious life there's no time to borrow  the time has come to be a family  ohhh...    think of all the love  pouring from our hearts  at the same time  yes think of all the light our looks    can shine and grow this world  at the same time  at the same time  yes think what we've been givin    and yet think what we could lose  all of life is in our trembling hands  it's time to overcome our fears  and join to build a world that loves and understands    it helps to think of all the hearts  beating in the world  and hope for all the hearts  healing in the world    there's a healing music in our hearts  beating in this world  at the same time  at the same timethis is me talking to you  tell me what your heart can do?  and take me by surprise  whatever you see  you'll never be alone with me    i close or open the door  telling you that less is more  you cannot disguise whatever you do  no one is above the law    in these dark and troubled times  people just surviving  we live a double life    you'd be safe and warm at home  something else is going on  we don't have to kiss  and say no more about it    and if your eyes are watching me  baby  life could be so beautiful  and we become invisible  the pleasure is the punishment for the crime    break away the chains that bind  it's not enough to be satisfied  it's knowing how it all begins  or knowing where the heart belongs    and we all make mistakes  it's your heart and my heart  and no one can take part  and our love  love above the law    so you decide we go insane  i know what you came here for  whether you're mine  i'll never be sure  we'll ever be above the law    on this dark and stormy night  where these walls may hide us   the walls may hide us   you sigh and let me in    you let me hold you in these arms of mine   one flame inside   tomorrow is eternity   temtation eyes   and we may get to kiss and say no more about it   no tears to cry     and if my eyes are watching you  baby  life could be so beautiful   so beautiful   and everything is possible   everything is possible   and we become invisible   we become invisible     it's your heart and my heart  and no one can take part  i'll always be with you  it's what i'm living for    the end of my rainbow  is outside your window  and our love is one love  love above the law   love above the law     it's your heart and my heart  and no one can take part  i'll always be with you  it's what i'm living for   it's what i'm living for     the end of my rainbow  is outside your window  love above the law once i found the perfect love  and you showed me everything there was  to know of love  time will not betray the truth  and for all the years we've shared  i celebrate with you  for you    un giorno t'incontrai  and

the roses all have left your cheek.  i've watched them fade away and die  your voice is sad when e'er you speak  and tears bedim your loving eyes.    oh! i will take you back  kathleen  to where your heart will feel no pain  and when the fields are fresh and green  i'll take you to your home again!    i know you love me  kathleen  dear  your heart was ever fond and true.  i always feel when you are near  that life holds nothing dear  but you.  the smiles that once you gave to me  i scarcely ever see them now  though many  many times i see  a dark'ning shadow on your brow.    oh! i will take you back  kathleen  to where your heart will feel no pain  and when the fields are fresh and green  i'll take you to your home again!    to that dear home beyond the sea  my kathleen shall again return.  and when thy old friends welcome thee  thy loving heart will cease to yearn.  where laughs the little silver stream  beside your mother's humble cot  and brightest rays of sunshine gleam  there all your grief will be forgot.    oh! i will take you back  kathleen  to where your heart will feel no pain  and when the fields are fresh and green  i'll take you to your home again! when a bird young and free  hangs around a certain tree  singing serenades that tell his love is true  that's because it's the natural thing to do    and when a cat on a fence  keeps his darling in suspense  and he's brave enough to face a well-aimed shoe  that's because it's the natural thing to do    and you know every dove  has its heart set on love  rabbits  too  pet and pat  and there's nothing wrong with that    when a boy such as i  tries so hard to qualify  with a very lovely lady such as you  can't you see it's the natural thing to do    and then the girl she acts demure  the boy he feels proud and sure  so proud and sure that he impulsively suggests a rendezvous  fine thing  that's because it's the natural thing to do    but the girl she just won't agree  she whimpers and she simpers  and he begs on bended knee  but she runs away because she knows full well he'll pursue  the chump  that's because it's the natural thing to do    then the boy in despair  waves his arms  tears his hair  stamps his feet and he acts like mad  then you know that he's got it bad    then the girl she ought to fall  if she's got a heart at all  she should take him in her arms  and kiss him too  oh! oh! just the natural thing to do oh  me name is macnamara  i'm the leader of the band  although we're few in numbers  we're the finest in the land  we play at wakes and weddings and at every fancy

tale  that's gonna rock you  about a man  the drifting kind  let the story now unwind  it's gonna shock you    some people said he was a ghost  wouldn't want to be his host  or just to meet him  and if he ever came their way  they'd be sticks and stones  i'd say  that would grieve him    he was a steppenwolf  a lost and lonely one  he was a steppenwolf  forever on the run  he was a steppenwolf  with a forgotten past  he was a steppenwolf  who found a love at last  he was a steppenwolf    the girl he met was out-of-sight  though she walked the streets at night  he didn't mind it  she seemed as happy as a song  and if anything was wrong  he didn't find it    they used to laugh and dance and drink  and not ever did he think of a payday  no matter where they ever were  every day he spent with her was a hey-day    he was a steppenwolf  and not a handsome man  he was a steppenwolf  who didn't know her plan  he was a steppenwolf  not very bright at all  he was a steppenwolf  just riding for a fall  he was a steppenwolf    one day she said "it's time you knew  that i started up with you  for just one reason  you're gonna do just what i want  'cause there's something that i want  and i ain't teasing  my life is empty all around  nothing that i ever found  would fulfill me  so for a while i'll be with you  when i say that we're through  you must kill me!"    he was a steppenwolf  he cried "it isn't fair"  he was a steppenwolf  "you know how much i care"  he was a steppenwolf  she said "this is the deal"  he was a steppenwolf  he saw this was for real  he was a steppenwolf    he was a steppenwolf  they spent a long last night  he was a steppenwolf  and with a smile she died  he was a steppenwolf  a lost and lonely one  he was a steppenwolf  forever on the run  he was a steppenwolf he left on a boat  just to follow a dream  he had to find  you can't hold a man  when he follows a dream  that's on his mind  i see a boat on the river  it's sailing away  down to the ocean  where to i can't say  boat on the river  it's sailing away  down to the ocean  where to i can't say  i waited for him  such a very long time  don't know what for  'cause i should have known  when he left on the boat  we'll meet no more  i see a boat on the river  it's sailing away  down to the ocean  where to i can't say  boat on the river  it's sailing away  down to the ocean  where to i can't say  boat on the river  it's sailing away  down to the ocean  where to i can't say  boat on the river  you're bound for the sea  if you should find him  please greet him from me  there were people who came  and said it's really a shame  why did he take off  to follow just a dream  but i guess they were wrong  in life you're sailing along  and things don't turn out  as simple as they seem  boat on the river  it's sailing away  down to the ocean  where to i can't say  i see a boat on the river  it's sailing away  down to the ocean  where to i can't say  i see a boat on the river  you're

such a lovely dear  he could preach the bible like a preacher  full of ecstasy and fire  but he also was the kind of teacher  women would desire    ra ra rasputin  lover of the russian queen  there was a cat that really was gone  ra ra rasputin  russia's greatest love machine  it was a shame how he carried on    he ruled the russian land and never mind the czar  but the cassock he danced really wunderbar  in all affairs of state he was the man to please  but he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze  for the queen he was no wheeler dealer  though she'd heard the things he'd done  she believed he was a holy healer  who would heal her son    but when his drinking and lusting and his hunger  for power became known to more and more people   the demands to do something about this outrageous  man became louder and louder.    "this man's just got to go!" declared his enemies  but the ladies begged "don't you try to do it  please"  no doubt this rasputin had lots of hidden charms  though he was a brute they just fell into his arms  then one night some men of higher standing  set a trap  they're not to blame  "come to visit us" they kept demanding  and he really came    ra ra rasputin  lover of the russian queen  they put some poison into his wine  ra ra rasputin  russia's greatest love machine  he drank it all and he said "i feel fine"    ra ra rasputin  lover of the russian queen  they didn't quit  they wanted his head  ra ra rasputin  russia's greatest love machine  and so they shot him till he was dead    oh  those russians keep on dancing in the streets  keep on dancing in the streets  keep on dancing in

been restored    he was only nineteen  when was sentenced to die  for something that somebody else did  and blamed on el lute  then they changed it to life  and so he could escape  from then only chased him  and searched for him day and night  all over spain  but the search was in vain  for el lute    he had only seen the dark side of life  the man they called el lute  and he wanted a home  just like you and like me  in a country where all would be free  though he taught himself  to read and to write  it didn't help el lute  he was one who had dared to escape overnight  they had to find  el lute    soon the fame of his tale  spread like wild fire  all over the land  were the prize on his head  people still gave him bread  and they gave him a hand  for they knew he was right  and his fight was their fight    no one gave you a chance  in the spain of those days  on was every place  they had put up the face of el lute  and he robbed where he could  just like once robin hood  they finally caught him  and that seemed the end  but they caught him in vain  cause a change came for spain  and el lute    he had only seen the dark side of life  and then freedom really came to his land  and also to el lute  now he walks in the line  of a sunny new day  the man they call el lute i was born and raised in the ghetto  talk with me and you'll know  i wasn't satisfied  with living on the

will live for evermore  because of christmas day.  long time ago in bethlehem  so the holy bible say   mary's boy child jesus christ  was born on christmas day.  hark  now hear the angels sing  a king was born today   and man will live for evermore  because of christmas day.  mary's boy child jesus christ  was born on christmas day.  while shepherds watch their flock by night   they see a bright new shining star   they hear a choir sing a song  the music seem to come from afar.  hark  now hear the angels sing  a king was born today   and man will live for evermore  because of christmas day.  for a moment the world was aglow  all the bells rang out  there were tears of joy and laughter  people shouted  "let everyone know  there is hope for all to find peace."  now joseph and his wife  mary  came to bethlehem that night   they found no place to bear her child  not a single room was in sight.  and then they found a little nook  in a stable all forlorn   and in a manger cold 'n' dark  mary's little boy was born.  hark  now hear the angels sing  a king was born today   and man will live for evermore  because of christmas day.  mary's boy child jesus christ  was born on christmas day.  oh a moment still worth was a glow  all the bells rang out  there were tears of joy and laughter  people shouted  "let everyone know  there is hope for all to find peace".  oh my lord...

that rainbow  when my smallest of dreams won't come true  i can take all the madness the world has to give  but i won't last a day without you    touch me and i end up singing  trouble seems to up and disappear  you touch me with the love you're bringing  i can't really lose when you're near  when you're near  my love    if all my friends have forgotten half their promises they're not unkind  just  hard to find  one look at you and i know  that i must learn to live without the rest  i've found the best    when there's no gettin' over that rainbow  when my smallest of dreams won't come true  i can take all the madness the world has to give  but i won't last a day without you    when there's no gettin' over that rainbow  when my smallest of dreams won't come true  i can take all the madness

me cry  just like before  it's yesterday once more    lookin' back on how it was in years gone by  and the good times that i had  makes today seem rather sad  so much has changed.    it was songs of love that i would sing to then  and i'd memorize each word  those old melodies still sound so good to me  as they melt the years away    every sha-la-la-la  every wo-o-wo-o  still shines   all the oldies but goodies   every shing-a-ling-a-ling  that they're startin' to sing's so fine    all my best memories come back clearly to me  some can even make me cry  just like before  it's yesterday

back to yesterday    and i'm ok    i often wonder why i carry all this guilt  when it's you that helped me put up all these walls i've built  shadows stir at night through a crack in the door  the echo of a broken child screaming "please no more"  daddy  don't you understand the damage you have done  to you it's just a memory  but for me it still lives on        it's not so easy to forget  all the marks you left along her neck  when i was thrown against cold stairs  and every day i'm afraid to come home  in fear of what i might see there        and i'm ok  i'm ok ooh oh  hey  hey  oh oh

prisoner  prisoner     i'm about to break  i can't stop this ache  i'm addicted to your allure  and i'm fiendin' for a cure  every step i take  leads to one mistake  i keep going right back  to the one thing that i need    i can't mend  this torn state i'm in  getting nothing in return  what did i do to deserve  the pain of this slow burn  and everywhere i turn  i keep going right back  to the one thing that i need to walk away from    i need to get away from ya  i need to walk away from ya    every time i try to grasp for air  i get smothered in despair  it's never over  over  seems i'll never wake from this nightmare   i let out a silent prayer  let it be over  over    inside i'm screaming  begging  pleading  no more    i don't know what to do  my heart has been bruised  so sad but

i speak what's on my mind  guess it's easier for you to swallow if i sat and smiled    when a female fires back suddenly big talker don't know how to act  so he does what every little boy would do  makin' up a few false rumors or two  that for sure is not a man for me  slanderin' names for popularity  it's sad you only get your fame through controversy  but now it's time for me to come and give you more to say      this is for my girls all around the world  who have come across a man that don't respect your worth  thinkin' all women should be seen and not heard  so what do we do girls  shout out loud  lettin 'em know were gonna stand our ground  so lift your hands high and wave 'em proud  take a deep breath and say it loud  never can  never will  can't hold us down    nobody can hold us down  never can  never will    so-what am i not supposed to say what i'm saying  are you offended with the message i'm bringin'  call me whatever 'cause you words don't mean a thing  guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what i sing  if you look back in history it's a common double standard os society  the guy gets all the glory the more he can score  while the girl can do the same yet you call her a whore  i don't understand why it's ok   the guy can get a way with it the girl gets named  all my ladies come together and make a change  and start a new beginning for us  everybody sang

'em know were gonna stand our ground  so lift your ahnds high and wave 'em proud  take a deep breath and say it loud  never can  never will  can't hold us down    here's something i just can't understand  if the guy have three girls then he's the man  he can even give her some head  or sex her off  but if a girl do the same  she's a whore  but the tables about to turn  i bet my fame on it  cats take my ideas  and put their name on it  it's aight though  you can't hold me down  i got to keep on moving  to my girls to their man who be trying to mac  do it right back to him and let that be that  you need to let him know that his game is whack  and lil' kim and christina aguilera got yo back    you're just a little boy  think you so cute  so coy  you must talk so big to make up for

time is up  'cause i've had enough  you were there by my side  always down for the ride  but your joy ride just came down in flames cause your greed sold me out inshame    after all of the stealing and cheating you probably think that  i hold resentment for you  but uh uh  oh no  you're wrong  'cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do  i wouldn't know  just how capable i am to pull through  so i want to say thank you  cause it      'cause it makes me that much stronger  makes me work a little bit harder  it makes me that much wiser  so thanks for making me a fighter  made me learn a little bit faster  made my skin a little bit thicker  makes me that much smarter  so thanks for making me a fighter    never saw it coming  all of your backstabbing  just so you could cash in on a good thing before i'd realize your game  i heard you're goin' round playin'  the victim now  but don't even begin feeling i'm the one to blame  'cause you dug your own grave  after all of the fights and the lies cause you're wanting to haunt me  but that won't work anymore  no more   it's over  'cause if it wasn't for all of your torture  i wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down  so i want to say thank you  cause it        how could this man i thought i knew  turn out to be unjust so cruel  could only see the good in you  pretended not to know the truth  you tried to hide your lies  disguise yourself  through living in denial  but in the end you'll see  you won't stop me    i am a fighter and i  i ain't goin' stop  there is no turning back  i've had enough        you thought i would forget   but i remember  'cause i remember  i remember  you thought i would forget   but i remember  'cause i remember  i remember     i feel like i've been locked up tight  a

stands beside me  to give this bride away    well  i'm standing in the chapel  wearing my white dress  i have waited for this moment  with tears of happiness  here i leave behind my past  by taking the chance  i've finally found the right man    thoughts racing fast through my mind  as i'm gazing down the aisle  that my future will mend the memories  torn between father and child    my emotions overload  'cause there is no hand to hold  there's no shoulder here to lean on  i'm walking all on my own    here i go    now i'm standing at four corners  to have and to hold  now  my love  you stand beside me  to walk life's winding road  and i owe it all to you  for taking that chance  you've shown me there's a right man  'cause i never knew the right man    well  i'm standing in the chapel

love  you stand beside me  to walk life's winding road  and i owe it all to you  for taking the chance    and one day  my little girl  will reach out her hand  she'll know i found the right man i

help  i gave up my ironing  you were thoughtful  careful not to hurt the relationship    what happened to those days when  you used to be compassionate  caring what i thought and said  so attentive gentleman  now it's hard to turn your head away from the tv set  taking me for granted lately  frankly  it's gotta quit    i feel under appreciated  now girls help me out  'cause you know what i'm talking about i say  i'm feeling underappreciated  for all the time and effort i have put in this commitment    back to the beginning  to the very beginning  when our love was something new  back when

realize  i seem to give more than i get  funny how things seem to change  after a few years commitment    used to talk for hours on end  'bout our dreams while we lay in bed  how i missed those days when you stayed awake  now you roll over and snore instead    i feel under appreciated  now girls help me out  'cause you know what i'm talking about  i say  i'm feeling under appreciated  for all the time and effort i have put in this commitment    oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  i miss those nice massages  the long for closeness  the way you talk  how it turned me on  the thoughtfulness and the sweetest lips    i needed those days back    i feel under appreciated  now girls help me out  'cause you know what i'm talking about i say  i'm feeling under appreciated  for all the time and effort i

shadows chasing rainbows  behind closed windows  behind closed doors    if walls could talk-oh  they would say "i want you more"  they would say "hey  never felt like  this before"  and that you would always be the one for me  just two people making memories  too good to tell  and these arms are never empty  when we're lying where we fall  we're painting pictures  making magic  taking chances   making love    if walls could talk-oh  they would say "i want you more"  they would say "hey  never felt like  this before"  and that you would always be the one for me    if walls had eyes  my  they would see the love inside  they would see me  in your arms in ecstasy  and with every move they'd know  i love you so    when i'm feeling weak  you give me wings  when the fire has no heat  you light it up again  when i hear no violins  you play my every string    so stop the press  hold the news  the secret's safe between me and you  walls  can you keep a secret?    if calls could talk  oh  they would say "i want you more"  they would say "hey  never felt like  this before"  and that you would always be  the one for me    if walls had eyes  my  they would see the love inside  they would see  me  in your arms in ecstasy  and with every move they'd know  i love you so so this is who i am  and this is all i know  and i must choose to live  for all that i can give  the spark that makes the power grow    and i will stand for my dream if i can  symbol of my faith in who i am  but you are my only  and i must follow on the road  that lies ahead  and i won't let my heart control my head  but

love's not something you can buy and sell  like pearls on a string  and if you want to know where we went wrong  you ought to stop and think    did you give enough love? did you show that you cared?  when i needed understanding were you really there?  whenever i was down did you try to pick me up?  maybe you should ask yourself  did you give enough love?    good intentions you know i had  right from the start  but if you wonder why we didn't last  just look inside your heart    did you give enough love? did you show that you cared?  when i needed understanding were you really there?  whenever i was down did you try to pick me up?  maybe you should ask yourself  did you give enough love?    did you give enough time  when i was alone  when i needed you there to make me feel i belonged  you just don't know what you did to me  i just had to be free    did ya  did ya  did ya give enough  did ya  did ya  did ya give enough    did you give enough love? did you show that you cared?  when i needed understanding were you really there?  whenever i was down did you try to pick me up?  maybe you should ask yourself  did you give enough love?   don't get so busy that you miss  giving just a little kiss  to the ones you love  don't even wait a little while  to give them a little smile  a little is enough    how many people are crying  people are dying  how many people are asking for love    don't save it all for christmas day  find a way  to give a little love everyday  don't save it all for christmas day  find your way  cause holidays have come and gone  but love lives on  if you give on  love    how could you wait another minute  a hug is warmer when you're in it  and baby that's a fact  and saying "i love you's" always better  seasons  reasons  they don't matter  so don't hold back    how many people in this world  so needful in this world  how many people are praying for love    don't save it all for christmas day  find a way  to give a little love everyday  don't save it all for christmas day  find your way  cause holidays have come and gone  but love lives on  if you give on  love    let all the children know  everywhere that they go  their whole life long  let them know love    don't save it all for christmas day  find a way  to give a little love everyday  don't save it all for christmas day  find your way  cause holidays have come and gone  but love lives on  if you give on  love  love you bought me flowers and you sold me a line  you gave me compliments and too much wine  i've played that game  i know all the moves    you show emotion but you hide what you feel  you play the innocent but i've watched you steal  i rest my case  you stand accused    but i must confess i was quite impressed  you seduced me with your easy charm  and i must admit i could fall for it    but if love is out the question  there's no point to this affection  i gotta have more than ecstasy  make me believe  i'm all you'll ever need  'cause if love is out the question  put a little heart in your intention  i gotta have more than ecstasy  make me believe  i'm all you'll ever need    you talk in circles when i need a straight line  you've got your principles and i've got mine  we all need commitment that's all i ask   is that a crime?     and i must confess i was quite impressed  i was losing to your winning ways  but i must resist there's no point to this    but if love is out the question  there's no point to this affection  i gotta have more than ecstasy  make me believe  i'm all you'll ever need    'cause if love is out the quesion i just gotta stop  little point to this affection i just want to stop  it makes no sense to carry on like this  if there's nothing between us you don't know  what you'll miss    no love  there's no love  baby it's true  there's no love    but if love is out the question  there's no point to this affection  'cause if love is out the question  put a little heart in your intention there were nights when the wind was so cold  that my body froze in bed  if i just listened to it  right outside the window    there were days when the sun was so cruel  that all the tears turned to dust  and i just knew my eyes were  drying up forever    i finished crying in the instant that you left  and i can't remember where or when or how  and i banished every memory you and i had ever made    but when you touch me like this  and you hold me like that  i just have to admit  that it's all coming back to me  when i touch you like this  and i hold you like that  it's so hard to believe but  it's all coming back to me   it's all coming back  it's all coming back to me now     there were moments of gold  and there were flashes of light  there were things i'd never do again  but then they'd always seemed right  there were nights of endless pleasure  it was more than any laws allow  baby baby    if i kiss you like this  and if you whisper like that  it was lost long ago  but it's all coming back to me  if you want me like this  and if you need me like that  it was dead long ago  but it's all coming back to me  it's so hard to resist  and it's all coming back to me  i can barely recall  but it's all coming back to me now  but it's all coming back    there were those empty threats and hollow lies  and whenever you tried to hurt me  i just hurt you even worse  and so much deeper    there were hours that just went on for days  when alone at last we'd count up all the chances  that were lost to us forever    but you were history with the slamming of the door  and i made myself so strong again somehow  and i never wasted any of my time on you since then    but if i touch you like this  and if you kiss me like that  it was so long ago  but it's all coming back to me  if you touch me like this  and if i kiss you like that  it was gone with the wind  but it's all coming back to me   it's all coming back  it's all coming back to me now     there were moments of gold  and there were flashes of light  there were things we'd never do again  but then they'd always seemed right  there were nights of endless pleasure  it was more than all your laws allow  baby  baby  baby    when you touch me like this  and when you hold me like that  it was gone with the wind  but it's all coming back to me  when you see me like this  and when i see you like that  then we see what we want to see  all coming back to me  the flesh and the fantasies  all coming back to me  i can barely recall  but it's all coming back to me now    if you forgive me all this  if i forgive you all that  we forgive and forget  and it's all coming back to me  when you see me like this  and when i see you like that  we see just what we want to see  al coming back to me  the flesh and the fantasies  all coming back to me  i can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now     it's all coming back to me now   and when you kiss me like this   it's all coming back to me now   and when i touch you like that   it's all coming back to me now   if you do it like this   it's all coming back to me now   and if we i know i never loved this way before  and no one else has loved me more  with you i've laughed and cried  i have lived and died  what i wouldn't do just to be with you    i know i must forget you to go on  i can't hold back my tears too long  though life won't be the same  i've got to take away  and find the strength i need to let you go    just walk away  just say goodbye  don't turn around now you may see me cry  i mustn't fall apart  or show my broken heart  or the love i feel for you    so walk away  and close the door  and let my life be as it was before  and i'll never never know  just how i let you go  but there's nothing left to say  just walk away    there'll never be a moment i'll regret  i've loved you since the day we met  for all the love you gave  and all the love we made  i know i've got to find the strength to say    just walk away  just say goodbye  don't turn around now you may see me cry  i mustn't fall apart  or show my broken heart  or the love i feel for you    so walk away  and close the door  and let my life be as it was before  and i'll never never know  just how i let you go  but there's nothing left to say  just walk away somewhere past midnight  when the moment is just right  we ride the streets of desire  we take it slow and  always get where we're goin'  'cause where there's smoke there's a fire    there's no denying  we don't need to keep trying  let's face the music and dance    well it's all semantic  what we never say  but what we feel ain't goin' away    so i wonder  how could we be feeling  more than this  tell me true  what it is  'cause    something has to make us feel this way  love by another name  doesn't matter 'cause it's still the same love  won't depend upon the words we say  love by another name  something happens when we're making love    si ce n'est pas l'amour  qu'est-ce que c'est?    we're superstitious  when every day is like christmas  no promise spoken  hearts don't have to get broken  more than a four letter word    if we're just pretending  we can write a new ending  if we don't like where it leads    well it's

a light that shines through  and takes me back home  takes me back home    all of the promises broken  and all of the songs left unsung  seems so far away as i make my way back to you      you gave me faith and you gave me a world to believe in  you gave me your love to believe in  and feeling this love i can rise up above  and be strong and be whole once again    i know that dreams we hold on to  can just fade away  and i know that words can be wasted  with so much to say  and i when i feel helpless there's always a hope that shines through  and makes me believe  makes me believe      and i see for one fleeting moment  a paradise under the sun  i drift away and i make my way back to you        [bridge:]  life goes on  can leave all sweet sorrow and pain  and life  hold on  to all that

night    when love was bound together  we lived it by the letter  can't close my eyes forever  'cause everything has changed and now    i ain't gonna look the other way  no more  after all the clouds go by  its just another empty sky  i ain't gonna wait to see the rain  no no  nothin's gonna make it right  look at me 'cause i choose life    its all about giving  its not about winning the game  my mind was open  ready or not you closed it up again  still i keep asking  if you got something to hide  i never stop learning  all the reasons why    it took about a minute  to find the point and hit

nothing's gonna make it right  used to be easy  oh i feel a little peculiar  feeling kinda strange  i don't know what it is  but i like the change  that comes over me  whenever he's around  it's as if my feet  don't even touch the ground    cause when i'm feeling down  he's there to pick me up  and when i talk too much  he doesn't interrupt  let me tell you there's no better guy  this is how it makes me feel inside    i wanna dance  dance  mmm  i wanna play  play   well can you hear my heartbeat  boom boom   a million miles away  he won't stop  stop  no no  till i drop  drop  yeah  and every day and night he tells me  i'm so special he could never give me up      i'm hooked on a feeling  a natural high  you better believe it  and the reason why  it's a thing called love  it makes me feel so alive  and i can't fight the feeling    somebody told me once  you only get one chance  so live your life  and do the best you can  once a day goes by  you never get it back  so live every minute  like it was your last    just dance  dance  mmm  come on play  play   and tell somebody you love them  i love you   at least once a day  and don't stop  stop   till you drop  drop   i didn't know that wanting someone so special  would come along to steal my heart        love  love  love  and don't let it slip  that was all you need  if you taste it once  it won't be enough        can't fight the feeling  i said  no  can't  can't  can't  can't fight the feeling  can't fight  oh!  you better believe it  you better believe it  can't fight the feeling did you ever fall in love  at the right time or place  does it always have to move  at its own kinda pace    when you're driving on cruise control  coming up a bumpy ride  and your heart is back in shape  then it hits you with no chance to hide

everything you've got  'cause in love there's no holding back back when i was a child  before life removed all the innocence  my father would lift me high  and dance with my mother and me  and then spin me around 'til i fell asleep  then up the stairs he would carry me  and i knew for sure i was loved  if i could get another chance  another walk  another dance with him  i'd play a song that would never ever end  how i'd love  love  love  to dance with my father again    when i and my mother will disagree  to get my way i would run from her to him  he'd make me laugh just to comfort me  yeah  yeah  then finally make me do just what my mama says  later that night when i was asleep  he left a dollar under my sheet  never dreamed that he would be gone from me  if i could steal one final glance  one final step  one final dance with him  i'd play a song that will never  never end  'cause i'd love  i'd love to dance with my father again    sometimes i'd listen outside her door  and i'd hear how my mama cried for him  i pray for her even more than me  i pray for her even more than me    i know i'm praying for much too much  but could you send back the only man she loved  i know you don't do it usually  but dear lord  she's dying  to dance with my father again  every night i fall asleep  and this is all i ever dream si j'ecrivais le livre de ma vie  je parlerais de mon amie madeleine  que j'ai vu rire et pleurer a la fois  un matin en sortant de chez moi    if i was writting the book of my life  i would talk about my friend madeleine  who i saw laughing and crying at the same time  one morning going ouf of my home  ce qu'elle a dit  je ne l'oublierai pas   que dieu benisse ta maison   m'a dit madeleine    what she told me  i will never forget  "god blesses your house"  told me madeleine  et moi j'ai compris la chance  que le ciel m'avait donne  de naitre ou les caresses sentent bon  si je dois courir le monde  mes pas me rameneront  toujours sur les chemins de ma maison    and i understood the chance  the sky has given me  to born where caresses smell good  if i have to run over the world  my steps will take me back  always on the paths of my house  see'est la

eyes and i am there  it's a better world  since you're my boy i'll always be your girl  your girl i learned the truth at seventeen  that love was meant for beauty queens  and high school girls with clear-skinned smiles  who married young and then retired    the valentines i never knew  the friday night charades of youth  were spent on one more beautiful  at seventeen i learned the truth    and those of us with ravaged faces  lacking in the social graces  desperately remained at home  inventing lovers on the phone  who called to say "come dance with me"  and murmured vague obscenities  it isn't all it seems at seventeen    a brown eyed girl in hand-me-downs  whose name i never could pronounce  said  "pity  please  the ones who serve  they only get what they deserve.  the rich relationed hometown queen  marries into what she needs  with a guarantee of company  and haven for the elderly"    so remember those who win the game  lose the love they sought to gain  in debentures of quality  and dubious integrity  the small town eyes will gape at you  in dull surprise when payment due  exceeds accounts received at seventeen    to those of us who knew the pain  of valentines that never came  and those whose names were never called  when choosing sides for basketball  it was long ago and far away  the world was younger than today  when dreams were all they gave for free  to ugly ducking girls like me    we all play the game and when we dare  we cheat ourselves at solitaire  inventing lovers on the phone  repenting other lives unknown  that call and say  "come dance with me"  and murmur vague obscenities  at ugly girls like me at seventeen i was walking stuck inside my head  i couldn't get out  turn the lights down  the voices inside are so loud.    need a jump start  catatonia  i couldn't feel  i wish that i could disappear  the voices inside are so real.    but you stood by my side.  night after night  night after night.  you loved me back to life  life  from the coma the wait is over.  you loved me back to life  life  from the coma  we're lovers again tonight.  back to life  back to life   back to life  back to life  yeah    you woke me up  one touch and i felt alive  you loved me back to life   back to life  thought i died.  the voices inside were so quiet.    but you stood by my side  night after night  night after night  you loved me back to life  life  from the coma the wait is over.  you loved me back to life  life  from the coma  we're lovers again tonight.    strong hands  thick skin  and an open heart  you saw through the pain  saw through the mask  you never gave up on me  yeah    life  life  from the coma  the wait is over.  you loved me back to life  life  from the coma  we're lovers again tonight    back to life  back to life   back to life  back to life  back to life  back to life   back to life  back to life  yeah from the fire in your words  to the dagger in your eye  i just have to lay my body down  go and lay my body down  i pretend to be asleep  but i know you hear me cry  i just have to lay my body down  go and lay my body down    but if i  really want a change  then i must admit  that i'm the one to blame    if i could break away  cut the cord  for worse or better  if i could turn the page  at last and say  goodbye forever  but on the other side  of yesterday  beyond the heartache  what if all i am  without the pain  is empty hearted  i could break away    is it true what people say  that it's darkest before dawn?  i just have to lay my body down  go and lay my body down  any hope we might have saved  is too weak to let live on  i just have to lay my body down  go and lay my body down    and if i  really want a change  then tonight i'm gonna need  all of my strength    if i could break away  cut the cord  for worse or better  if i could turn the page  at last and say  goodbye forever  but on the other side  of yesterday  beyond the heartache  what if all i am  without the pain  is empty hearted  i could break away    oh  anything is better than this  i know  anything is better    if i could break away  cut the cord  for worse or better  if i could turn the page  at last and say  goodbye forever  but on the other side  of yesterday  beyond the heartache  what if all i am  without the pain  is empty hearted    if i could break away  if i could turn the page  but on the other side  of yesterday  beyond the heartache  what if all i am  without the pain  is empty hearted  i could break away i thought i had it long ago   i held on  but it let go.  it kissed me on a subway train  and i melted    it got my hand it brushed my cheek   it moved right in  it cut me deep.  you know it even had a name   i really felt it.    i didn't know love   not even close   this is more beautiful and frightening than i've ever known   it's making me weak   making me strong   it's making me afraid i'm gonna wake up  and find it gone   i didn't know love.    it's a blessing  it's a curse.  you know you've found it when it hurts.  it can drive you off a cliff   but it's worth it.    careful where you spend the night   it's complicated when it's right.  you can make me such a mess   yeah you're perfect!    but i didn't know love   not even close   this is more beautiful and frightening than i've ever know   it's making me weak   making me strong   it's making me afraid i'm gonna wake up  and find you gone   i didn't know love.  no  i didn't know love.    now you're lying in my arms  beside me.  in the past i'd settled for a touch   i'd tell myself it was enough   i was lying  lying  lying.  'cause i didn't know love    i didn't know love   not even close   this is more beautiful and frightening than i've ever known.  it's making me weak   making me strong  it's making me afraid i'm gonna wake up and find you gone.    i didn't know love   no  i didn't know love   i didn't know love.  i didn't know love.i've been bruised and i've been broken  can't believe that i put up with all this pain  i've been used and i was choking on the promise  i would never fall again    i used to sing to your twisted symphony  the words that had me trapped inside your misery  but now i know  the reason why i couldn't breathe      cause all i want is everything you're not  so go ahead and slam the door  cause you can't shut me out  and no i don't  i don't care what you say  cause all i really  all i really want  is everything you're not    everything you're not not not    your darkness was my weakness but it turns out  that it only went so deep  a meaningless diversion that is all that you  ever meant to me    and i am done with your twisted symphony  the words that had me sound like stolen poetry  i tore the pages and i can finally breathe        i want a gentleman who treats me like a queen  i need respect  i need love  nothing in between    i will not spell it out for you if you can't see  cause you're not worthy  you don't deserve me  a now i'm gone    everything you're not  not  not

won't settle down  like a child running scared from a clown  i'm terrified of what you do  my stomach screams just when i look at you    run far away so i can breathe  even though you're far from suffocating me  but i can't get my hopes too high  'cause every hello ends with a goodbye    but you're so hypnotizing  you've got me laughing while i sing  you've got me smiling in my sleep  and i

ends  that's why i'm building my body  it hurts me but i'm building my body  and i know what the pain is worth  i know i feel the pain of birth  i'm pushin' up  and gettin' down with my body  there's no-one else around with my body  one look says i'm a stone disgrace  don't kick no sand in my face    because i'm building my body strong  i'm watching what i eat  and i'm sorting out right from wrong  hey  not a lot of meat  and i know that it won't be long  before i gotta quit smoking    because i'm building my body  i'm peaceful when i'm building my body  i'm sweating out mistakes i've made  i'm getting back the dues i've paid  i'm doing more  and getting sore with my body  but i'm gaining a rapport with my body  and this seems like the perfect time  they say i'm in my prime    that's why i'm building my body strong  i'm thinking at the table  and i'm sorting out right from wrong  i'm reading every label  and i know that it won't be long  before i gotta quit smoking    'cause i'm building my body  there's someone else inside of my body  he's waiting to be born again sometimes when i'm thinkin' that love's not around  my heart begins sinkin'  i don't hear a sound  and the world is in blackness  no light shines on me  i suffer no blindness  no one can i see  then a flash from the heavens like a loud jagged wire  and the silence is broken  and the night is on fire.      it's like chain lightning  this love that i feel.  who know's where it strikes or when it will hit   how long it will last  or when it will quit.    in the forest i'm burning  struck down by the blast  the fever is churning  and the heat rises fast.  and those standing nearest can show their concern  but i swear if they touch me that they too will burn.  they fear for their lives for death will soon dwell  in the warmth of your love is the fire of hell.        and soon the sparks scatter and wind whips the flame  and love will soon shatter what it cannot tame  and the cycle continues  from life into dust  for i am now in you with the fire of lust.  and i hear the explosion  of thunder and rain   the water is falling  the ashes remain.        the indian's tell us that the phoenix can rise  from the smoldering ashes that once were my eyes  and watch beautiful colours from black and from grey  be formed into wings and take me away  where evil is darkness and goodness is light  and love is the lightning that cuts through the night  and strikes only once in a dark place in time  and forms a gold stairway that all of us climb. in the beginning there was nothingness and god but waved his hand  and from the endless void there sprang the beauty of the land  and high above the canyon walls the diamond stars were new  and breezes blew from nothingness and herbs and grasses grew  and silent creatures roamed the earth and multiplied their [do7]kind  and man was but a molecule that god had left behind.      we have grown we have grown  we have captured the throne  of the kingdom god made for our winning.  we have grown we have grown  but our children alone  have so little time left for beginning.    and mountains sprang and chaos rang the overture of life  and rivers coursed the twisted blade of natures sharpest knife  and cut beneath the rolling dales a gateway to the sea  while tidal waves and mighty gales were heard in symphony  and sunshine fell upon the waves and warmed the virgin land  and from the mud a drop of blood was left upon the sand.     chorus   and eagles flew from craggy peaks above the garden wall.  the drop of blood became a man  the tree of life grew tall.  and perfect in his loneliness  a rib pulled from his chest  formed a sweet companion of pulchritude and breast.  and from the tree of knowledge god said they could not eat.  and perfect was their paradise unto the serpent at their feet.     chorus   tree of knowledge  tree of death  upon the ground they trod.  the serpent said your eye's will see and ye will be a god.  defy the word and eat the fruit and ye will never die  and you will chart your destiny and rule the earth and sky.  and man was banished east of eden. see what we have lost.  for though the father sets the price  the children pay the cost.     chorus  one  two  three  four!    fortune has me well in hand  armies wait at my command  my gold lies in a foreign land buried deep beneath the sand  the angels guide my ev'ry tread  my enemies are sick or dead  but all the victories i've led haven't brought you to my bed    you see  everybody loves me  baby  what's the matter with you?  won'tcha tell me what did i do to offend you?    now the purest race i've bred for thee to live in my democracy  and the highest human pedigree awaits your first-born boy  baby  and my face on ev'ry coin engraved  the anarchists are all enslaved  my own flag is forever waved by the grateful people i have saved    you see  everybody loves me  baby  what's the matter with you?  won'tcha tell me what did i do to offend you?    now  no land is beyond my claim when the land is seized in the people's name  by evil men who rob and maim  if war is hell  i'm not to blame!  why  you can't blame me  i'm heaven's child  i'm the second son of mary mild  and i'm twice removed from oscar wilde  but he didn't mind  why  he justsmiled    yes  and the ocean parts when i walk through  and the clouds dissolve and thesky turns blue  i'm held in very great value by everyone i meet but you  'cause i've used my talents as i could  i've done some bad  i've done somegood  i did a whole lot better than they thought i would so  c'mon and treat me likeyou should!    because everybody loves me  baby  what's the matter with you?  won'tcha tell me what did i do to offend you?    everybody loves me  baby  what's the matter with you?  won'tcha tell me what did i do to offend you?    yeah  everybody loves me  baby  what's the matter with you?  won'tcha tell me what did i do to offend you? i was walking by the graveyard  late last friday night   i heard somebody yelling  it sounded like a fight.  it was just a drunken hobo dancing circles in the night   pouring whiskey on the headstones in the blue moonlight.  so often have i wondered where these homeless brothers go   down in some hidden valley were their sorrows cannot show   where the police cannot find them  where the wanted men can go.  there's freedom when your walking  even though you're walking slow.    smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can   that homeless brother is my friend.    it's hard to be a pack rat  it's hard to be a 'bo   but living's so much harder where the heartless people go.  somewhere the dogs are barking and the children seem to know  that jesus on the highway was a lost hobo.  and they hear the holy silence of the temples in the hill   and they see the ragged tatters as another kind of thrill.  and they envy him the sunshine and they pity him the chill   and they're sad to do their living for some other kind of thrill.    smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can   that homeless brother is my friend.    somewhere there was a woman  somewhere there was a child   somewhere there was a cottage where the marigolds grew wild.  but some where's just like nowhere when you leave it for a while   you'll find the broken-hearted when you're travelling jungle-style.  down the bowels of a broken land where numbers live like men   where those who keep their senses have them taken back again   where the night stick cracks with crazy rage  where madmen don't  pretend   where wealth has no beginning and poverty no end.    smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can   that homeless brothe starry  starry night  paint your palette blue and gray  look out on a summer's day  with eyes that know the darkness in my soul  shadows on the hills  sketch the trees and the daffodils  catch the breeze and the winter chills  in colors on the snowy linen land    now i understand what you tried to say to me  and how you suffered for your sanity  how you tried to set them free  they would not listen  they did not know how  perhaps they'll listen now    starry  starry night  flaming flowers that brightly blaze  swirling clouds in violet haze  reflect in vincent's eyes of china blue  colors changing hue  morning fields of amber grain  weathered faces lined in pain  are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand    now i understand what you tried to say to me  and how you suffered for your sanity  and how you tried to set them free  they would not listen  they did not know how  perhaps they'll listen now    for they could not love you  but still your love was true  and when no hope was left in sight  on that starry  starry night  you took your life as lovers often do  but i could have told you  vincent  this world was never meant  for one as beautiful as you    starry  starry night  portraits hung in empty halls  frameless heads on nameless walls  with eyes that watch the world and can't forget  like the strangers that you've met  the ragged men in ragged clothes  a silver thorn  a bloody rose  lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow    now i think i know what you tried to say to me  and how you suffered for your sanity  and how you tried to set them free  they would not listen  they're not listening still  perhaps they never willand if she asks you why you can tell her that i told you  that i'm tired of castles in the air  i've got a dream i want the world to share in castle walls  just leave me to despair    hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky  a dream come true  i'll live there 'til i die  i'm asking you  to say my last goodbye  the love we knew  ain't worth another try    save me from all the trouble and the pain  i know i'm weak but i can't face that girl again  tell her the reasons why i can't remain  perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain    oh  but how can words express the feel of sunlight  in the morning in the hills away from city strife  i need a country woman for my wife  i'm city born but i love the country life    for i can not be part of her "cocktail-generation partner's waltz "  devoid of all romance  the music plays and everyone must dance  i'm bowing out  i need a second chance    save me from all the trouble and the pain  i know i'm weak but i can't face that girl again  tell her the reasons why i can't remain  perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain    and if she asks you why you can tell her that i told you  that i'm tired of castles in the air  i've got a dream i want the world to share in castle walls  just leave me to despair chorus    i don't want to be like old george reeves  stuck in a superman role.  i've got a long way to go in my career  and some day my fame will make it clear  that i had to be a superman    verse 1  he came from another place deep in his mind  as far as the planets in space.  as galaxy's mysteries start to unwind  some changes are bound to take place.    though gravity constantly weighs on my travels  my mission is close to adrift  though i can be strong when my power unravels  i still come to you for a lift.     chorus     verse 2  i know i can fly when my plane hits the sky  i believe i've got nothing to lose.  but when i'm alone with the bed and the phone  i get the terminal metropolis blues    i flew to the coast where superman's ghost  lay shot on the bedroom floor  he said "watch out for tv it crucified me   but it can't crucify me no more."     chorus     verse 3  "i'm red white and blue  i've got justice to do  i'm the man of your fantasy dreams  but i'm an alien man from an alien land  who's alive on your orthicon screens.  i once ruled the world and when flags were unfurled    i performed for you live not on tape.  but the public is cruel when played for a fool  as you see by the blood on my cape."     chorus     verse 4    "well i never was real or stronger than steel.  i'm a figment of freudian need.  and the video screen is a psychotic scene  and it's all done with mirrors and green    my agent just called  the talks have been stalled  i soon will be pulled from the air.  but the image persists in the video mists  that a superman still will be there!"     chorus  from what i have been hearing  dear  you've really got it made  got a lot of fellers on your lover's hit parade

ought to know.  well i've been thinking about you day and night  and i don't know if it will work out right  but somehow i think that it just might  if we try.  somehow i think that it just might if we try.  yes somehow i think that it just might if we try.the angels are lost in the city of stars  wise men are down on their knees  and the fruitman of freeway will sell you his cars  when he's sure that you can't find the keys  and the ladies on magdalene lane  all worship the sun and the sand  and the migrants who come can't complain  for this is their promised land    mgm studios can't make the nut  they're auctioning dorothy's shoes  gable is gone  the good witch is a slut  and i've got the parking-lot blues  the wizard brought benzedrine smiles  and he never let dorothy doze  ha- she died as she walked down the aisle  and all that remains is her clothes    over the rainbow a kansas tornado  can twist up a little girl's head  aunt em's on relief and the tin man's a thief  and even the wizard can't wake the dead    the prophet has come to the kingdom of lights  but there's no one to listen or learn  and the saviour performs for the prophet's delight  while dissenters are banished or burned  and the heretics beg to be heard  but the saviour's on tour for the week  salvation is found in his word  if only he'd learn how to speak!    and lincoln is laughing with amos and

for sale  a piece of your heart will do for a start  you can send us the rest in the mail  for we have our own families to feed  and we can't let them starve just for you  but we'd rather not watch while you bleed  so come back in an hour when you're through    it's just another city full of sorrow  makes no differ there is no time to discuss or debate  what is right  what is wrong for our people  time has run out for all those who wait  with bent limbs and minds that are feeble    and the rain falls and blows through their window  and the snow falls and blows through their door  and the seasons revolve 'mid their sounds of starvation  when the tides rise  they cover the floor    and they come from the north  and they come from the south  and they come from the hills and they valleys  and they're migrants and farmers  and miners and humans  our census neglected to tally    and the rain falls and blows through their window  and the snow falls and blows through their door  and the seasons revolve 'mid their sounds of starvation  when the tides rise  they cover the floor    and they're african  mexican  caucasian  indian  hungry and hopeless americans  the orphans of wealth and of adequate health  disowned by this nation they live in    and with weather-worn hands  on bread lines they stand  yet but one more degradation  yes  and they're treated like tramps  while we sell them food stamps  this thriving and prosperous nation    and the rain falls and blows through their window  and the snow falls and blows through their door  and the seasons revolve 'mid their sounds of starvation  when the tides rise  they cover the floor    and with roaches and rickets and rats in the thickets  infested  diseased  and decaying  with rags and no shoes and skin sores that ooze  by the poisonous pools they are playing    in shacks of two rooms that are rotting wood tombs  with corpses breathing inside them  yes  and we pity their plight as they call in the night  and we do all that we can do to every thread of creation is held in position  by still other strands of things living.  in an earthly tapestry hung from the skyline  of smoldering cities so gray and so vulgar   as not to be satisfied with their own negativity  but needing to touch all the living as well.    every breeze that blows kindly is one crystal breath  we exhale on the blue diamond heaven.  as gentle to touch as the hands of the healer.  as soft as farewells whispered over the coffin.  we're poisoned by venom with each breath we take   from the brown sulfur chimney and the black highway snake.    every dawn that breaks golden is held in suspension  like the yoke of the egg in albumen.  where the birth and the death of unseen generations  are interdependent in vast orchestration  and painted in colors of tapestry thread.  when the dying are born and the living are dead.    every pulse of your heartbeat is one liquid moment  that flows through the veins of your being.  like a river of life flowing on since creation.  approaching the sea with each new generation.  you're now just a stagnant and rancid disgrace  that is rapidly drowning the whole human race.    every fish that swims silent  every bird that flies freely   every doe that steps softly.  every crisp leaf that falls  all the flowers that grow  on this colorful tapestry  somehow they know.  that if man is allowed to destroy all they need.  he will soon have to pay with his life  for his greed. on the first floor' on the first floor  on the first floor there's a young girl reeling  her body's numb and without feeling  as illusions dance on the midnight ceiling  now she's falling  now she's kneeling  it's almost like she's bowed in prayer  a savior she's about to bear  she screams for help  but no one's there  on the first floor  on the first floor people walk the halls  but none can hear her desperate calls  there is no sound beyond the walls  so to the telephone she crawls  she telephones her only friend  the one on whom she can depend  but the phone rings on without an end  then rings no more on the first floor  there's a party on the second floor  and through the picture window you can see them all  they're laughing and they're dancing  admiring the renoir that's hanging on the wall  but in the master bedroom where the coats are piled high  a silent  saddened lady thinks of what it's like to die  and as she dwells on all the years she still has left to face  she wonders how she'll ever find someone to take his place  then suddenly she's jarred by the ringing of the phone  oh  why do you ring now  just when i want to be alone?  so she walks into the bathroom and drinks some water from a cup  but the telephone stops ringing just before she picks it up  my family was very poor  so i worked hard to be secure  i married one i had to wed  and not the one i loved instead  when i was young my blood ran wild  but we stayed married for the child  now three flights up  i'm all alone  my wife is dead  my child is grown  my daughter leads a wayward life  she's been a failure as a wife  and though she lives just one floor down  she never calls or comes around  step off the platform and onto the train  look out your window and into the rain  watch all the buildings that pass as you ride  and count all the stories that go on inside  and then ask yourself if it must be this way  should walls and doors and plaster ceilings  separate us from each others' feelings?at the foot of the cross  where grace and suffering meet  you have shown me your love  through the judgment you received  and you've won my heart  and you've won my heart  now i can  trade these ashes in for beauty  and wear forgiveness like a crown  coming to kiss the feet of mercy  i lay every burden down at the foot of the cross  at the foot of the cross  where i am made complete  you have given me life  through the death you bore for me  and you've won my heart  and you've won my heart  now i can  trade these ashes in for beauty  and wear forgiveness like a crown  coming to kiss the feet of mercy  i lay every burden down at the foot of the cross  and wear forgiveness like a crown  coming to kiss the feet of mercy  i lay every burden down at the foot of the cross  and you've won my heart  and you've won my heart  now i can  trade these ashes in for beauty  and wear forgiveness like a crown  coming to kiss the feet of mercy  i lay every burden down  i trade these ashes in for beauty  and wear forgiveness like a crown  coming to kiss the feet of mercy  i lay every burden down  i lay every burden down  every burden  i lay every burden down  at the foot of the cross  at the foot of the cross  at the foot of the cross  at the foot of the cross   lord  you seem so far away  a million miles or

what makes somebody love someone?  i wish that's the way that we could be  but love is up to love and not to me  i can't help the way that i don't feel  take what isn't there and make it real  you're where i should be going  but my heart is at the wheel  and i can't help the way that i don't feel  it's nothing that you did or haven't done  who knows what makes somebody love someone?  i wish that's the way that we could be  but love is up to love and not to me  i can't help the way but i don't feel  take what isn't there and make it real  you're where i should be going  but my heart is at the

do with the wine  or the music that's flooding my mind  but never before have i been so sure  you're the someone i dreamed i would find    it's the way you make me feel  the moment i am close to you  it's a feeling so unreal  somehow i can't believe it's true  the pounding i feel in my heart  the hoping that we'll never part  i can't believe this is really happening to me    i close my eyes and count to ten  and when i open them you're still here  i close my eyes and count again  i can't believe it but you're still here    we were strangers a moment ago  with a few dreams but nothing to show  the world was a place  with a frown on its face  and tomorrow was just  i don't know    but the way you make me feel  the moment i am close to you  makes today seem so unreal  somehow i can't believe it's true  tomorrow will you still be here?  tomorrow will come but i fear  that what is happening to me  is only a dream    i close my eyes and count to ten  and when i open them you're still here  i close my eyes and count again  i can't believe it but you're still here  i close my eyes and count to ten  and when i open them you're still here i know some lovers would be satisfied  with sweet  'i love yous' and some pretty lines  but that won't get you in this heart of mine  no  you'll never steal my heart away  with just words  sweet words that you say  it is all in the things that you do

estate's fine  smoking like a dragon but don't chase lines    hey  i haven't slept for the past week  and two hours ain't enough for me  i feel inspired  at quarter to three a.m.  i haven't changed since our last meet  i'm still getting all my meals for free  i think i'm being shunned by my feet again    'cause it's not a homeless life for me  it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be  and it's not a homeless life for me  it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be  and it's not a homeless life for me  it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be  and it's not a homeless life for me  yeah    and now i'm sitting on a night bus flicking through my ipod  feeling kinda tired so i try to close my eyes up  driver turn the lights  off  lights on  on stage  mics on  song plays  nice one  gotta keep my hype strong  truth be  never went to uni  people see right through me but i'm not a fool  see  i'm never gonna do one  gonna live past 22   done everything i need to  except get a 2:1    i haven't slept for the past week  and two hours ain't enough for me  i feel inspired  at quarter to three a.m.  i haven't changed since our last meet  i'm still getting all my meals for free  i think i'm being shunned by my feet again    'cause it's not a homeless life for me  it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be  and it's not a homeless life for me  it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be  and it's not a homeless life for me  it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be  and it's not a homeless life for me  yeah    when i feel cold  you keep me warm  and i'm not looking for some loose change  just wanna find a true mate  who wants to be my duvet  hey    it's not a homeless life for me  it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be    and it's not a homeless life for me  it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be  and it's not a homeless life for me  it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be  and it's not a homeless life for me  it's just i'm home less than i'd like to

me  it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be    and it's not a homeless life for me  yeah i met you when i was a teen but then you were one as well  and i could play the guitar just like ringing a bell  sometimes i wonder  and any other summer could you have been my part time lover  to me listening to stevie wonder  under the covers where we used to lay  and re-stacks is what the speakers play  i'll be on tour almost every day  when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay  just watching the dvd  smoking illegal weed  getting high as two kites  and we needed to breathe  we used each other's air just for the people to see  and stay up all night like when we needed to sleep  we go anywhere  our minds would take us  and also you are beautiful without your make-up  and you don't even need to worry about your weight 'cause  we can all be loved the way god made us  and time's the only reason that we could break up  cause you would always tell me away too much  distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane  or make a mistake  say it again    oh nina  you should go nina  'cause i ain't never coming home  nina oh  won't you leave me now  and i've been living on the road nina  and then again you should know nina  cause that's you and me both  nina oh  won't you leave me now  now    and every weekend in the winter  you'd be wearing my hoodie  with draw strings pulled tight  to keep your face in the cold  taking day trips to the local  where we eat on the road  cause every day when i was away  we'd only speak on the phone  watching blue planet  creating new habits  and if we were two rabbits  and then you vanish  back to 'burgh with all the celtics  i'd dissapear  you call me selfish  i understand  but i can't help it  i put my job before everything  except my family and friends  but you'll be in between forever  so i guess we'll have to take a step back  overlook the situation  cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications  and i'm not saying we should be taking a break  just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late  so we can either deal with the pain  or wait to get on a plane  but in the day we'll have to say it again    oh nina  you should go nina  'cause i ain't never coming home  nina oh  won't you leave me now  and i've been living on the road nina  and then again you should know nina  cause that's you and me  nina oh  won't you leave me now  now    love will come and love will go  but you can make it on your own  sing that song  go  oh won't you leave me now  people grow  and fall apart  but you can mend your broken heart  take it back  oh won't you leave me now    oh nina  you should go nina  'cause i ain't never coming home  nina oh  won't you leave me now  and i've been living on the road nina  and then again you should know nina  cause that's you and me both  nina oh  won't you leave me now  now    oh nina  you should go nina  'cause i ain't never coming home  nina oh  won't you leave me now  and i've been living on the road nina  then again you should know nina  cause that's you and me both  nina oh  won't you leave me now  now [intro]  oh oh oh  oh oh oh  oh oh oh  oh oh oh    [verse 1]  waking up  midnight november  and just still in my bed  it's kinda rough  cause since i met ya  there's things we've never said    [pre-chorus]  so if i go for a little while longer  when i'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road  if you say go  i would stop everything oh  my heart would play the role now  and act like it's never been broke      though my

angels to fly  angels to fly  to fly  fly  for angels to fly  to fly  to fly  angels to die things were all good yesterday  and then the devil took your memory  and if you fell to your death today  i hope that heaven is your resting place  i heard the doctors put your chest in pain  but then that could have been the medicine  and now you're lying in the bed again  either way i'll cry with the rest of them    and my father told me  son  it's not his fault he doesn't know your face  and you're not the only one  although my grandma used to say  he used to sing    darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night  and we'll lie inside  a little while here  oh  i could look into your eyes until the sun comes up  and we're wrapped in light  in life  in love  put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut  for they're designed to be together oh  with your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one  and we're set alight  we're afire love  love  love oh    and things were all good yesterday  then the devil took your breath away  and now we're left here in the pain  black suit  black tie standin' in the rain  and now my family is one again  stapled together with the strangers and a friend  came to my mind i should paint it with a pen  six years old i remember when    and my father told me  son  it's not his fault he doesn't know your face  and you're not the only one  although my grandma used to say  he used to sing    darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night  and we'll lie inside  a little while here  oh  i could look into your eyes until the sun

sing hallelujah  hallelujah it's just another night  and i'm staring at the moon  i saw a shooting star and thought of you  i sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew  if you were here  i'd sing to you  you're on the other side  as this skyline splits in two  miles away from seeing you    but i can see the stars from america  i wondered do you see them too?    so open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet  and all of the lights will lead into the night with me  and i know these scars will bleed  but both of our hearts believe  all of these stars will guide us home    i can hear your heart on the radio beats  they're playing "chasing cars" and i thought of us  back to the time you were lying next to me  i looked across and fell in love  so i took your hand back through london streets and knew  everything led back to you    so can you see the stars over amsterdam?  hear the song our heart is beating to?    so open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet  and all of the lights will lead into the night with me  and i know these scars will bleed  but both of our hearts believe  all of these stars will guide us home    and all  and all  and all  i can see the stars from america unhappy days that left us on the floor  and you breathe me 'til you're not feeling sure  everything will brighten up  if we go to brighton  i'll take you along the pier  everything will lighten up  if you feel too frightened  i'll make it disappear  dear    and darling  don't be nervous  i'll understand if you'll let me go  i did this on purpose now    and when i'm missing you  i'll stop eating food  and i'll squeeze into a dress so i can be like you  and then i'll see your bitterness and why you're leaving too  maybe i'll put you to a test and say that 'i love you'  i think that i love you    and sunny days that left my skin bright red  and you squeeze me 'til these thoughts leave my head  if it gets too complicated   i'll keep up and be frustrated  can you see what's wrong?

time  couple women by my side  i got sinning on my mind  sipping on red wine  i've been sitting here for ages  ripping out the pages  how'd i get so faded?  how'd i get so faded?    [pre-chorus]  oh no no don't leave me lonely now  if you loved me how'd you never learn  ooh  coloured crimson in my eyes  one or two could free my mind      this is how it ends  i feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  fading out again  i feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  so tell me when it kicks in  so tell me when it kicks in    [verse 2]  i've been looking for a lover  thought i'd find her in a bottle  god  make me another one  i'll be feeling this tomorrow  lord forgive me for the things i've done  i was never meant to hurt no one  i saw scars upon a broken hearted lover    [pre-chorus]  oh no no don't leave me lonely now  if you loved me how'd you never learn  ooh  coloured crimson in my eyes  one or two could free my mind      this is how it ends  i feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  fading out again  i feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  so tell me when it kicks in  so tell me when it kicks in    [bridge x5]  all the voices in my mind  calling out across the line  all the voices in my mind  calling out across the line  all the voices in my mind  calling out across the line  all the voices in my mind  calling out across the line    [outro x6]  tell me when it kicks in  i saw scars upon her  tell me when it kicks in  broken hearted she's like cold coffee in the morning  i'm drunk off last nights whisky and coke  she'll make me shiver without warning  and make me laugh as if i'm in on the joke    and you can stay with me forever  or you could stay with me for now    tell me if i'm wrong  tell me if i'm right  tell me if you need a loving hand  to help you fall asleep tonight  tell me if i know  tell me if i do  tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to    i'll wake with coffee in the morning  but she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea  outside the day is up and calling  but i don't have to be so  please go back to sleep    stay with me forever  or you could stay with me for now    tell me if i'm wrong  tell me if i'm right  tell me if you need a loving hand  to help you fall asleep tonight  tell me if i know  tell me if i do  tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to    'cause i love the way you wake me up  for goodness sake will my love not be enough?    tell me if i'm wrong  tell me if i'm right  tell me if you need a loving hand  to help you fall asleep tonight  tell me if i know  tell me if i do  tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to    tell me if i'm wrong  tell me if i'm right  tell me if you need a loving hand  to help you fall asleep tonight i wanna be drunk when i wake up  on the right side of the wrong bed  and never in a excuse i made up  tell you the truth i hate  what didn't kill me  it never made me stronger at all.  love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me  so now i'll maybe leave back there  i'm sat here wishing i was sober  i know i'll never hold you like i used to.    but the house gets cold when you cut the heating  without you to hold i'll be freezing  can't rely on my heart to beating  'cause you take part of it every evening  take words out of my mouth just from breathing  replace with phrases like when you're leaving me.    should i  should i?  and maybe i'll get drunk again  i'll be drunk again  i'll be drunk again  to feel a little love    i wanna hold your heart in both hands  not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a coke can  and i've got no plans for the weekend  so shall we speak then  keep it between friends  no  i know you'll never love me like you used to.    but may be other people like us  who see the flicker of the clip when they light up  flames just create us  burns don't heal like before  you don't hold me anymore.    on cold days cold plays out like the band's name  i know i can't heal things with a hand shake  you know i can't change as i began saying  you cut me wide open like landscape  open bottles of beer but never champagne  to applaud you with the sound that my hands make.    should i  should i?  and maybe i'll get drunk again  i'll be drunk again  i'll be drunk again  to feel a little love.    all by myself  i'm here again  all by myself  you know i'll never change  all by myself  all by myself  i'm just drunk  again  i'll be drunk again  i'll be drunk again  to feel a little love. i fell in love next to you  burning fires in this room  it just fits  light and smooth  like my feet in my shoes  little one  lie with me  sew you heart to my sleeve  we'll stay quiet underneath  shooting stars if it helps you sleep  and hold me tight  don't let me breathe  feeling like you won't believe    there's a firefly loose tonight  better catch it before it burns this place down  and i lie if i don't feel so right  but the world looks better through your eyes    there's a firefly loose tonight  better catch it before it burns this place down  and i lie if i don't feel so right  but the world looks better through your eyes    teach my skin those new tricks  warm me up with your lips  heart to

love like her   'cause lately i've been waking up alone   paint splattered teardrops on my shirt   told you i'd let them go   and that i'll fight my corner   maybe tonight i'll call ya   after my blood turns into alcohol   no  i just wanna hold ya.    give a little time to me or burn this out   we'll play hide and seek to turn this around   all i want is the taste that your lips allow   my  my

night and joy be with you all    of all the comrades that ever i had  they are sorry for my going away  and all the sweethearts that ever i had  they would wish me one more day to stay  but since it

poured your heart into  but you never tried  i've fallen from grace  took a blow to my face  i've loved and i've lost  i've loved and i've lost    explosions on the day you wake up  needing somebody and you've learned  it's okay to be afraid  but it will never be the same  it will never be the same    you left my soul bleeding in the dark  so you could be king  the rules you set are still untold to me and i  lost my faith in everything  the nights you could cope  your intentions were gold  but the mountains will shake  i need to know i can still make    explosions on the day you wake up  needing somebody and you've learned  it's okay to be afraid  but it will never be the same    and as the floods move in  and your body starts to sink  i was the last thing on your mind  i know you better than you think  'cause it's simple darling  i gave you a warning  now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces  so watch them fall with you  in slow motion  i pray that you will find peace of mind  and i'll find you another time  i'll love you  another time    explosions on the day you wake up  needing somebody and you've learned  it's okay to be afraid  but it will never be the same breathe your smoke into my lungs  in the back of the car with you i stare into the sun  still not too old to die young  the lovers hold on to everything  and others hold on to anything    i

of empty bullets  and my blood is all i see  as you steal my soul from me    alarms will ring for eternity  the waves will break every chain on me    and god knows  i'm not dying but i breathe now

and time i wasted  and in each line upon my face  is proof i fought and lived another day    when did life become this place of madness?  drifting on an empty sea of waves and sadness?  i make believe i'm in control  and dream it wasn't all my fault    when your feet don't touch the ground  when your voice won't make a sound  here  it's safe  in this place  up off the clouds    when your feet don't touch the earth  you can't feel the fates that hurt  and you're free  there's no need to come down  when your feet don't touch the ground    everyday just feels a little longer  why am i the only one not getting stronger?  running around pretending life's a play  it doesn't make the darkness go away    i may be young but i can still remember  feeling full of joy  crying tears of laughter  now all my tears are all cried out  make-believe  but count me out    cause my feet are on the ground  and the inner voice i found  tells the truth  "there's no use  if your head's in the clouds"    with my feet on solid earth  i can face the fates that hurt  and in time  i'll be fine  i'll come 'round    i was once like you  life was a maze  i couldn't find my way out  but what i say is true  you will be amazed  make-believe and you will find out that it's true    when your feet don't touch the ground  when your voice won't make a sound  here  it's safe. in this place  up off the clouds  when your feet don't touch the earth  you can't feel the fates that hurt  and you're free  there's no need  to come down  when your feet don't touch the groundyou're so quiet  but it doesn't faze me  you're on

right   to go on every night  just talking to the moon about you. now when i learned to play the ukulele   i used to practice day and night.  my pals all roared as i fumbled at a chord   but i couldn't get the darned thing right.    they laughed when i started to play  they laughed so hearty.  only two lessons i had  i went up the scale and down the scale   it wasn't so bad  but one chap  he said "oh what a mug  why you can't learn that way"  he took the uke off me and said "now i'll have a try"  just then the 'g' string bust and flew right into his eye.  he laughed when i started to play  but he didn't laugh again all day    oh they laughed when i started to play  oh they laughed so hearty  strip poker that's a good game   once i lost my trousers to a gambling dame  but when  i started shuffling the cards  then the luck came my way.  i won a frock and undies  she was left i declare  as bare as any savage and as savages are bear  she laughed when i started to play   but she didn't laugh again that day.    now once i watched a game of water polo   with players from a ladies school.  the girls all cried "won't you make up a side?"  so i dashed into the bathing pool.  they laughed when i started to play  oh how they laughed so hearty.  in goal  i paddled about  a big ball in the water soon i started to clout.  each time  that it came bobbing back  well i smacked it away.  just then the ball turned over and a girl said "no larks"   "seven times you've hit me where i can't show the marks."  she laughed when i started to play   but she didn't laugh again that day. now everybody's got a crazy notion of their own  some like to mix up with a crowd  some like to be alone  it's no one else's business as far as i can see  but every time that i go out the people stare at me    with my little ukulele in my hand  of course the people do not understand  some say why don't you be a scout  why don't you read a book?  but i get lots more pleasure when i'm playing with my uke.    of course i take no notice you can tell  for mother's sound advice will always stand.  she said "my boy do what i say and you'll never go astray  if you keep your ukulele in your hand  yes son  keep your ukulele in your hand. "    while walking down the prom last night as peaceful as can be  when some young girl said "what about a stroll down by the sea?"  she said her name was jane and that she'd just come for the day.  she looked so young and harmless that i couldn't turn away    so with my little ukulele in my hand  i took a stroll with jane along thesand.  we walked along for miles without a single care or frown  but when we reached the sand hills she said "come on let's sit down."  i felt so shy and bashful sitting there  'cause the things i said she didn'tunderstand  she said "your love just turns me dizzy  come along big boy get busy"  but i kept my ukulele in my hand  yes sir  i kept my ukulele in my hand.    made up my mind that i'd get wed some eighteen months ago.  i also bought a book about the things you want to know.  but just about a week ago i got a awful fright   i had to get dressed quickly in the middle of the night.    and with my little ukulele in my hand  i ran along the road for dr. brand  it didn't take him long to get his little bag of tools.  i held his hat and coat and let him have my book of rules.  out of the bedroom door he looked and smiled    he said  "come inside and see your wife and child."  my heart it jumped with joy  i could see it was a boy  for he had a ukulele in his hand  oh baby  he had a ukulele in his hand.ooh    don't make me over  now that i'd do

must learn   and we are led to those who help us most to grow   if we let them   and we help them in return.  well i don't know if i believe that's true   but i know i'm who i am today because i knew you.    kurt: like a comet pulled from orbit  as it passes a sun.  like a stream that meets a boulder  halfway through the wood.  who can say if i've been changed for the better?  beacuse i knew you   i have been cahnged for good.    rachel: it well may be that we will never meet again   in this lifetime.  so let me say before we part   so much of me is made from what i learned from you.  you'll be with me like a hand print on my heart.  an now whatever way our stories end   i know you have re-written my by being my friend.    rachel: like a ship blown from it's mooring  by a wind off the sea.  like a seed dropped by a skybird in a distand wood.  who can say if i've been changed for the better?  but because i knew you...    kurt: because i knew you...    both: i have been changed for good.    rachel: and just to clear the air   i ask forgiveness   for the things i've done  you blame me for.    kurt: but then i guess we know there's blame to share.    both: and none of it seems to matter anymore.    kurt: like a comet pulled from orbit   rachel: like a ship blown from it's mooring   kurt: as it passes a sun.   rachel: by a wind off the sea   kurt: like a stream that meets a boulder

makes me that much smarter  so thanks for making me a fighter    how could this man i thought i knew  turn out to be unjust so cruel  could only see the good in you  pretended not to see the truth  you tried to hide your lies  disguise yourself  through living in denial  but in the end you'll see  you won't stop me    i am a fighter and i   i am a fighter   i ain't gonna stop  i ain't gonna stop   there is no turning back  i've had enough    makes me that much stronger  makes me work a little bit harder  it makes me that much wiser  so thanks for making me a fighter  made me learn a little bit faster  made my skin a little bit thicker  makes me that much smarter  so thanks for making me a fighter    you thought i would forget  but i  i remembered  'cause i remembered  i remembered  you

keep it from me  no matter how you try  'cause i know you too well  for you to ever think  you could tell me a lie  yes  i know you too well  no one knows you like i do and it's so easy to tell  when you look away  there's something you're hiding  i know you too well  too well  maybe the timing isn't right  maybe i see the end in sight  is it over baby  is it hurting you to stay?  maybe you don't know what to do  you can't find a way to break the news  think it over  baby  it hurts me more this way  i'd rather have you tell me to my face  than tell me every thing's all right  what you don't wanna say is there in black and white  'cause i know you too well  for you to ever think  you could tell me a lie  yes  i know you too well  no one knows you like i do and it's so easy to tell  when you look away  there's something you're hiding  i know you  too well  too well  i'd rather have you tell me to my face  than tell me every thing's all right  what you don't wanna say is there in black and white  'cause i know you too well  for you to ever think  you could tell me a lie  yes  i know you too well  no one knows you like i do and it's so easy to tell  when you look away  there's something you're hiding  i know you  too well  too well  know you  'cause i know you too well  for you to ever think  you could tell me a lie  yes  i know you too well  no one knows you like i do and it's so easy to tell  when you look away  there's something you're hiding  i know you  too well  too well   one day soon  it's gonna happen just by chance  you and i will just succumb to this romance  on that day my love will find you  and you'll discover what a wonder life can be  and you will know how much i love you  if we were lovers  if we were more than just good friends  i know how good it could be  just by the way you're looking at me  as if we were lovers  if we were lovers  i've waited so long for that day  i think you feel the same way  you try so hard not to give it away  afraid that i'll discover  what in your heart you know  is meant to be  darlin' if you want it to be me  to be the one to say  i want you  then i'm telling you now  gonna find a way somehow  to be your lover  and spend the whole night making love  then find it's never enough  just think what we are giving up  every day that we're not lovers  few times in our lives can we feel this way  it would be a shame just to throw it away  time is slipping by  we don't know what's ahead  i don't want to look back and have any regrets  one day soon  it's gonna happen just by chance  you and i will just succumb to this romance  on that day my love will find you  and you'll discover what a wonder life can be  and you will know how much i love you  on that day my love will find you  and you'll discover what a wonder life can be  and you will know how much i love you  how much i love you   to be completely honest  it scares me to imagine  what life would be without you    and for this very reason  i ask you to forgive me  for what i'm putting us through    although there are so many things  against us  i've decided  that i'm not giving you up  no    thinking back  i see what we have  is something different  i think we've known all along  so how fair would it be  to divide this love's existence  between what's right and what's wrong    and you  always wondering if we'll make it  time will tell you  that i'm not giving you up  no  no    we'll find a way to be together  however long it takes  wherever  if it means having you for only a moment  a moment just might be enough  i'm not giving you up  no  no i'm not giving you up  no    screaming in the silence the promises we've spoken  come back to haunt me  false and broken  quiet desperation to see we're lost forever  searching for water in the desert    no  i refuse to have to do  without your kisses  i'm not giving you up  no  no    we'll find a way to be together  however long it takes  wherever  if it means having you for only a moment  a moment just might be enough  i'm not giving you up  no    no i'm not giving you up  no  no i'm not giving you up love  love  love  love  love  say the word so very losely  where we come from is love  love  pure love  and we're on our way back home    and on that way  you never look back  'cause there's nothing there to see  just look around you  there's always someone that's in need    of maybe just kindness  as we watch each other bleed  from wounds we choose  we never lose    love  love  love  love  love  misunderstood yet so desired  we pay the cost for love  love  real love  but we get back so much more  so much more    so many questions  beginning to unfold  i look for the answers  in the middle of my soul    i know you're out there  and it's not like i've been told  so i run to you  i run to you    to find the path of the right love  oh yeah the path of the right love  we're on the path of the one love  oh yeah the path of the right love    love  love  love  love  love  all around yet so elusive  if we don't reach out for love  love  this love  we're all just wasting time  precious time    when in the long run  what's meant to be will be  those things we ask for  become our destiny    but while we're living  our souls can not be free  eventually  we will come to see  to find the path of the right love  right love  right love    oh yeah the path of the right love  we're on the path of the one love  yeah  yeah  oh yeah the path of the right love  and that love  love  love  true love    must surely be good  must surely be kind  and that love sweet love  strong love  is meant to be yours  is meant to be mine  and i do believe if we share this life    we must learn to share all it's pain and strife  to find the path of the right love  oh yeah the path of the right love  we're on the path of the one love    oh yeah the path of the right love  to find the path of the right love  oh yeah the path of the right love  we're on the path of the one love    oh yeah the path of the right love  aspire to your inevitable bliss  and every grace will be given you will you remember me baby?  one day you should go away  i know you say you'll always stay  oh

us  but they do nothing but argue  without putting much priority on it  i'll read the rest of it from now  oh no  this is probably a parody  i'm sure for someone  it's a fake story  i can't wear any shoes but my own  that's alright  since i can walk like that  i know  it's a common story  but to me  it's a real story  without waiting for the rest of it  i'll go to see you from now     uh  uh

grain bread.  something tastes different  maybe it's my tongue.  something tastes different  suddenly i'm not so young.    i'm just a stranger  even to myself.  a re-arranger of the proverbial bookshelf.  don't be a fool girl  tell him you love him.  don't be a fool girl  you're not above him.    i never thought i could love anyone but myself.  now i know i can't love anyone but you.  you make me think that maybe i won't die alone.  maybe i won't die alone.    kiss the boys as they walk by  call me their baby.  but little do they know  i'm just a maybe.  maybe my baby will be the one to leave sore.  maybe my baby will settle the score.    i never thought i could love anyone but myself.  now i know i can't love anyone buy you.  but you make me think that maybe i won't die alone.  maybe i won't die alone.    what have i become?  something soft and really quite dumb.  because i've fallen  oh  'cause i've fall- fallen  oh 'cause i've fall-fall-fallen  so far away from the place where i started from.    i never thought i could love anyone.  i never thought i could love anyone.  i never thought i could love anyone.  but you  but you  but you  but you  but you but you make me think that maybe i won't  die alone.  maybe i won't die alone. i have taken a wrong turn?  when will i learn? when will i learn?  shall i show them all my scars?  cherry red bleeding burn    like an angry apple tree  i throw my apples if you get to close to me  but if i look to my right  will i see the one i fight for?  if i look to my right or if i turn to my left  will i see that i've kept my heart locked up?  locked up so tight    love  love  love  love is everywhere  but not a drop for me to drink  tie me up and bind my feet  drop me in and watch me sink    like an angry apple tree  i throw my apples if you get to close to me  but if i look to my right  will i see the one i fight for?  if i look to my right or if i turn to my left  will i see that i've kept my heart locked up?  locked up    if i was 17 i could find it in between  the cushions of somebody's couch  i could find it  i could find it  if i was 17 i could find it in a dream  a dime a dozen kind of love  i could find it i could find it    but i'm not 17  and i lost it in between the birthday cakes  and past mistakes that roll on by    but if i look to my right  will i see the one i fight for?  if i look to my right or if i turn to my left  will i see that i've kept my heart locked up?  locked up so tight don't delay  something tells me i gotta go away  maybe it's the way we always stay when our hearts have gone  we can't hold us anymore  no we've got to fold  down to the floor  yes i know it's cold but baby our hearts have gone    just because there once was love  don't mean a thing  don't mean a thing  just because there once was love  don't mean a thing  don't mean a thing    just because there once was love  don't mean a thing  don't mean a thing  just because there once was love    i gotta see if

i think of you    so life moves slowly when you're waiting for it to boil   feel like i watch from six feet under the soil  still  want to hold you and kiss behind your ears   but i recount the countless tears that i lost for you    but before you finally go there's one thing you should know  that i promise...      starting now  i'll never know your name  starting now  i'll never feel the same  starting now  i wish you never came into my world    i want to crawl back inside my bed of sin  i want to burn the sheets that smell like your skin  instead i'll wash them just like kitchen rags

girl came by  she had eyes like the rising tide  he felt a sharpness deep inside  the kind of ache that can't be satisfied    we hate the rain when it fills up our shoes  but how we love when it washes our cars  we love to love when it fills up the room  but when it leaves oh we're cursing the stars    so he turned to the radio  and he went to a picture show  tried to find someone else who knows  all the hurt that a heart can hold    she smelled like cinnamon and winter clove  and sparked like firewood inside a stove  wanted to ask her just to sit and stay  instead he watched as she walked away    we hate the rain when it fills up our shoes  but how we love when it washes our cars  we love to love when it fills up the room  but when it leaves oh we're cursing the stars    we hate the rain when it fills up our shoes  but how we love when it washes our cars  we love to love when it fills up the room  but when it leaves oh we're cursing the stars living up while we're going down  everything that we don't know now  goodbyes and golden nights sing "woh oh oh"  you're the one with pioneer heart  i'm the one in the brand new start  i feel it coming like oh oh oh    headlights

night town  to sing "woh oh oh oh oh oh"  we're singing "woh oh oh oh oh oh"    light up our memory  never knew what they meant to me  hold on like you gotta let me go  you're the one with the cavalier smile  i'm the one with the open mile  bright lights with no regrets  sing "woh oh oh"    headlights  heartbreak  we'll go  our own way  we got one life today    so when the lights go out

ever in yourlife.  i'm sorry for wasting your time.    who am i to say this situation isn't great? it's my job to make the most of it  of course i didn't know that it would happen to me. not that easy.    hey what's that you say? you're not blaming me for anything that's great  but i don't break that easy. does it fade away?  so that's why i'm apologizing now for telling you i thought that we could makeit  i just don't get enough to believe that we've both changed.    who am i to say this situation isn't great? it's my time to make the most ofit  how could i ever know that this would happen to me  not that easy  no  all along the fault is up for grabs why don't you have it  well it's for sale go make your offer  i'll sell it for no less than what ibought it for  pay no more than absolutely zero.    well neither one of us deserves the blame because opportunities moved us away  and it's not an easy thing to learn to play a game that's made for two that'syou and me  the rules remain a mystery. see it can be easy.    who am i to say this situation isn't great? it's our time to make the most ofit  how could we ever know that this would happen to me  not that easy  no  all

an auctioneer  auctioneer.  and mother clings to anniversaries.  and his sister  she's got a little bit of mister in her  and her brothers goin round  round  round his bed  and i said  and i say  i say  well believe what i say  i said  did i  did i  fool ya  fool ya  well didn't daddy fool ya?  he sang once and a goin twice  hes gone for 35 or 40  and he go  once and a goin twice  hes gone for 35... sold to the middle line.  they go once and a goin twice  and aint it nice?  and oh lord they made it up to 65  they go once and a goin twice  and aint it nice? aint it nice oh aint it nice?  ... said aint it nice for the price?  i said i got a nice life for the price is right  body rock  rody bock  and they boss  said a come on down  down  down  said come on down.  youre the next big winner  so come on down  oh oh oh  but i  but i  i said i  i give and give and i lay it all down now  well look what i've found  i give and give  i said i give and give and i lay it all down  now look what i've found  ah look what i've found  blue skies  they're smiling at me  and that's my favorite melody.  but i can't read and i can't read and  i can't read between the things unseen  and i don't mind and i don't mind and i don't mind  if i don't find because i've tried  i'm absolutely definite  absolutley positive  absolutely definetly positive.  i'm absolutely definite  absolutley positive  absolutely definetly positive  i'm absolutely definite  absolutley positive  absolutely definetly positive.  and i'm absolutely definite  absolutley positive  absolutely definetly positively represented.  so i  why why  ohma why the bother with it all?  did i  did i fool ya?  well d you were born together and together ye shall be forever  until death could scatter  shouldn't matter in the memory of god above  let the wind of heaven dance between you too  allowing time and space to bring you closer to everlasting love  so what should you do if god moves through you?    when love beckons its ways are often hard and steep  and his wings unfold  ye yield to all that it speaks  though a sword it might be hidden there among the pinions  oh you  may wear a wound that truly spoke to you  believe in all that voice and follow through  so what should you do when god moves through you?    love possesses nothing  nor would it ever be possessed  love is love sufficient unto love  and you can figure out the rest    god rests in reason  so what should you do  oh  oh  when god moves through you?    well  your children will not be your children  maybe the daughter  the son of a beginning  they'll come through your womb but not be coming from you  they will be with you but they do not belong to you    you can give them your love but not your thoughts  'cause they'll arrive with their own hearts  they're the coming of angels this blessed season  and then they'll sing oh yea  god rests in reason  god rests in reason  so what should you do when god moves through you?    and think not you can direct the course of  love itself directs the course of love  believe not god is in your heart  child  but rather you're in the heart of god    so you see so far i'm all right  pleasant and awkwardly polite  watching carefully the comedy  the tick tock moments of the grid lock day    and why i'm singing  about the fact that i'm giving up everything  and giving back to the people that made me want to change  my evil  lazy ways  i'm gonna give you one more phrase to explain    see i believe in only one thing  i believe in good orderly d i are e c t i o n  i'll spell it again  roll it with abbreviation  easy as a 1 2 3  spell it backwards it's a d o g  'cause it's a dog eat dog world  what a life girl  maybe you should make you my wife girl    and i believe in omni possibility  it's nothing more than good orderly direction  nothing more than good orderly direction  nothing more than good orderly direction  this is nothing more than good orderly direction  so what should you do when god moves through you?  what should you do when god moves through you? hello  tell me you know  yeah  you figured me out  something gave it away  and it would be such a beautiful moment  to see the look on your face  to know that i know that you know now    and baby that's a case of my wishful thinking  you know nothing  cause you and i  why  we go carrying on for hours  on and  we get along much better  than you and your boyfriend      well all i really wanna do is love you  a kind much closer than friends use  but i still can't say it after all we've been through  and all i really want from you is to feel me  as the feeling inside keeps building  and i will find a way to you if it kills me  if it kills me    well how long  can i go on like this   wishing to kiss you   before i rightly explode?  this double life i lead isn't healthy for me  in fact it makes me nervous  if i get caught i could be risking it all    baby there's a lot that i miss  in case i'm wrong        if i should be so bold  i'd ask you to hold my heart in your hand  tell you from the start how i've longed to be your man  but i never said a word  i guess i'm gonna miss my chance again        if it kills me  i think it might kill me    and all i really want from you is to feel me  it's a feeling inside that keeps building  and i will find a way to you if it kills me  if it kills me  if it kills me  it might kill me well you done done me and you bet i felt it  i tried to be chill but you're so hot that i melted  i fell right through the cracks  and now i'm trying to get back  before the cool done run out  i'll be giving it my bestest  and nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention  i reckon it's again my turn   to win some or learn some    but i won't hesitate no more  no more  it cannot wait  i'm yours    well open up your mind and see like me  open up your plans and damn you're free  look into your heart and you'll find love love love love  listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing  we are just one big family  and it's our god-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved      so i won't hesitate no more  no more  it cannot wait i'm sure  there's no need to complicate  our time is short  this is our fate  i'm yours    i've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror  and bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer  but my breath fogged up the glass  and so i drew a new face and i laughed  i guess what i been saying is there ain't no better reason  to rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons  it's what we aim to do  our name is our virtue    but i won't hesitate no more  no more  it cannot wait i'm yours    well open up your mind and see like me  open up your plans and damn you're free  look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours  so please don't please don't please don't  there's no need to complicate  'cause our time is short  this  oh this  this is our fate  i'm yours    haneen serhan

indeed  he's the reason that i'm laughing  even if there's no one else  he said  you've got to love yourself    you say  you shouldn't mumble when you speak  but keep your tongue up in your cheek  and if you stumble on to  you better remember that it's humble that you seek  you got all the skill you need   individuality  you got something  call it gumption  call it anything you want  because when you play the fool now  you're only fooling everyone else  you're learning to love yourself    there's no price to pay  when you give and what you take   that's why it's easy to thank you  you    let's say take a break from the day  and get back to the old garage  because life's too short anyway  but at least it's better then average  as long as you got me  and i got you  you know we'll got a lot to

someone do the math  for the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer  got to find another way to live the life of leisure  so i drop my top  mix and i mingle  is everybody ready for the single and it goes      ha la la la la  now listen closer to the verse i lay   ha la la la la   it's all about the wordplay   ha la la la love   the wonderful thing it does  because  because  i am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's  yeah the mister a-z  they say i'm all about the wordplay    and it's time to get ill i got your remedy  for those who don't remember me  well let me introduce you to my style  i try to keep a jumble  and the lyrics never mumble  when the music's makin' people tongue-tied  you want a new song  like a new religion  music for the television  i can't do the long division  someone do the math  for the poeple write me off like i'm a one-hit wonder  got to find another way to keep from goin' under  pull out the stops  got your attention  i guess it's time again for me to mention  the wordplay        i built a bridge across the stream of consciousness  it always seems to be a flowin'  but i don't which way my brain is goin'  oh the ryhmin' and the timin'  keeps the melodies inside me  and they're comin'  til i'm running out of air  are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head  are you listening to a single word i've said    listen closer to the words i say  we're sticken' to the wordplay  ha la la la love  the wonderful thing it does  because  because  i am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's  yeah the mister a-z  they say i'm all about the wordplay    i'm all about the wordplay  stickin' with the wordplay  ha la la la love  i love the wonderful thing it does  because  because  the oh's and ah's and fa-la-la's fall back in love  for the mister a-z they say  is all about the wordplay was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me  oh things are gonna happen naturally  and taking your advice i'm looking on the bright side  and balancing the whole thing  but often times those words get tangled up in lines  and the bright lights turn to night  until the dawn it brings  a little bird who'll sing about the magic that was you and me    'cause you and i both loved  what you and i spoke of  what you and i spoke of  others only dream of the love that i love    see i'm all about them words  over numbers  unencumbered numbered words  hundreds of pages  pages  pages forwards  more words then i had ever heard and i feel so live  now you and i  you and i  not so little you and i anymore  and with this silence brings a moral story  more importantly evolving is the glory of a boy    you and i both loved what you and i spoke of  and others just read of and if you could see now  well i'm already finally out of    and it's okay if you have go away  just remember the telephone works both ways  and if i never ever hear it ring  if nothing else i'll think the bells inside  have finally found you someone else and that's okay  'cause i'll remember everything you sang    you and i both loved what you and i spoke of  and others just read of and if you could see now  well i'm already finally out of words you've got the best of both worlds  you're the kind of girl who can take down a man   and lift him back up again  you are strong but you're needy   humble but you're greedy  based on your body language  and shoddy cursive i've been reading  your style is quite selective   though your mind is rather reckless  well i guess it just suggests  that this is just what happiness is      and what a beautiful mess this is  it's like picking up trash in dresses    well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write  kind of turn themselves into knives  and don't mind my nerve you could call it fiction  but i like being submerged in your contradictions dear  cause here we are  here we are    although you are biased i love your advice  your comebacks they're quick  and probably have to do with your insecurities  there's no shame in being crazy   depending on how you take these  words i'm paraphrasing this relationship we're staging      and what a beautiful mess this is  it's like picking up trash in dresses    well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say  kind of turn themselves into blades  kind and courteous is the life i've heard  but it's nice to say that we played in the dirt  cause here  here we are  here we are    [x7]   here we are     we're still here      and what a beautiful mess this is  it's like taking a guess when the only answer is yes    and through timeless words and priceless pictures  we'll fly like birds  not of this earth  and tides they turn and hearts disfigure  but that's no concern when we're wounded together  and we've torn our dresses and stained our shirts  but it's nice today  oh the wait was so worth it mystery the moon  a hole in the sky  a supernatural nightlight  so full but often right  a pair of eyes a closin' one  a chosen child of golden sun  a marble dog that chases cars  to farthest reaches of the beach and far beyond into the swimming sea of stars    a cosmic fish they love to

couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive  was i too young to see this with my eyes?    by the pool last night  apparently  the chemicals weren't mixed properly  you hit your head and then forgot your name  and then you woke up at the bottom by the drain  and now your altitude and memory's a shame      what about taking this empty cup and filling it up  with a little bit more of innocence  i haven't had enough  it's probably because when you're young  it's ok to be easily ignored  i like to believe it was all about love for a child    and when the house was left in shambles  who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass  was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around  well i'm far too old to care about that now        it's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce  i've been enjoying both my christmases and my birthday cakes  and taking drugs and making love at far too young an age  and they never check to see my grades  what a fool i'd be to start complaining now        it was all about love... do you hear me   i'm talking to you  across the water across the deep blue ocean  under the open sky  oh my  baby i'm trying  boy i hear you in my dreams  i feel your whisper across the sea  i keep you with me in my heart  you make it easier when life gets hard      i'm lucky i'm in love with my best friend  lucky to have been where i have been  lucky to be coming home again    oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh    they don't know how long it takes  waiting for a love like this  every time we say goodbye  i wish we had one more kiss  i'll wait for you i promise you  i will        lucky we're in love in every way  lucky to have stayed where we have stayed  lucky to be coming home someday    and so i'm sailing through the sea  to an island where we'll meet  you'll hear the music fill the air  i'll put a flower in your hair  though the breezes through the trees  move so pretty you're all i see  as the world keeps spinning round  you hold me right here right now        i'm lucky we're in love in every way  lucky to have stayed where we have stayed  lucky to be coming home someday    oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh it's been nice to hold your hand  as we shifted through this twisted abandon  i would like to think that you will know your way  we have dodged the ropes of rain  well the cats and dogs well they love to play  on the handsome fella with umbrella  who once saved you your day    and i will ask you to open my door from your side  from the inside after you drive  because i wanna stay wet for a little bit longer  that's why    i warm the engine compartment up  while i stand here and think it up  but it's a little too early to bury the worries  til this wish is my command    and i wonder  wonder which one of us  is gonna state the obvious  and i wonder if you already know  that i gotta let you go    i know this ain't the way i planned it  i guess i ain't the great romantic  and i'm not doubling back now  no doubling back  doubling back now    well before i catch you complaining that it hardly rains at all  let me stop to lock the top  for fear of it falling hard  by the eyes were ears and the arms are  scars of where the war was waged on words that we heard as a joke  how did it drown our love    oh lord  when it rains it's sure to pour  but when i look in your eyes  i fear i won't see surprise  that i'm not doubling back cause  i wonder  wonder which one of us  is gonna state the obvious  and then i wonder if you already know  that i gotta let you go    i know this ain't the way i planned it  i guess i ain't the great romantic  and i'm not doubling back now  no doubling back now  doubling back now  no doubling back now  doubling back now  no doubling back now  doubling back now  no doubling back now  doubling back now  no doubling back now  doubling back now  no doubling back now  no turning around now  no going back now  no what's the worst thing that could happen?  we could change our minds.  that seems to be the hottest topic at this time.  we are sitting around in the meditation  dragging  chasing   wonderin' whose holdin' whose got the will to draw the line.    i know you've got something burning up inside   it's so unhealthy but so good for me  oh!  said if i didn't know  and if i didn't know  well if i didn't know that youloved me would you tell me?  well god only knows our contradiction's to quitting  is a hate to loverelationship thing.  a fire under you is so fulfilling   i fear there's nothing more.    i'm giving  giving you  the choke hold   my flirting with disaster is mighty loved.  ugggh you  you're so bold   my wanting to kiss you still is not enough.  i'm getting over  all the comments.  i'm feeling statements made by people are nonsense.  i'm getting stronger  by the minute.  and once i slip into position i'll swing you and turn you all around.    you are the sweetest thing i've found since whenever   you're the only way my time is measured.  you might be the silent type   but your appetizing louder now.  it's crazy how you're killing me.  woo  you're killing me  but i like your    red top and matching bottoms.  you know the ones  the ones you got on   pull them over your skinny self  but don't cover your tattoo.  woo  cause i like to look at you  yeah   i love that smell on you   and i got your special place against this face for tasting too.    and i like it natural   no need for chemicals.  foggin?up my senses  you're making me sensless  you're calling it sexual.    and you're going to get yours  my lady.  might even be today.  and it ain't no thing because i'll be rolling right along with you-woo-woo.    you are the sweetest thing i've found since whenever.  you're the only way my time is measured.  you might be the silent type.  but you're appetizing louder now.  it's crazy how you're killing me.  and give us both a break.  and to give us back a taste when the way things were before they made thelaws   and to give us both a chance   but it won't be the last romance cause when the weekend starts the guiltyparty's on.    breakdown!!  weekend party's over   don't stop  let's get closer.  friday  got cold shoulder   monday  got a new composure.    weekend party's over   don't stop  let's get lower.  i won't blow your cover   opportunistic lover.    weekend party's over   don't stop

madness  i sing about it in all my sadness  it's not falsified to say that i found god so inevitably well   it still exists pale and fine. i can't dismiss  and i won't resist and if i die well at least i tried    and we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain  and pour over everything we say we trust  it happened again  i listened in through hallways and thin doors  where the rivers unwind  rust and in the rain endure.  the rust and the rain are sins  and i'm in like flynn again    so go on place your order now cause some other time is right around the clock  you can stand in line. it finally begins just around the clock  you can have your pick if your stomach is sick whether you eat or not  and there is just one thing that i never forgot    and we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain  and pour over everything we say we trust  it happened again  i listened in through hallways and thin doors  where the rivers unwind  rust and in the rain so easy  these are the comforts that be    you see well i'm feeling lucky oh well  maybe that's just me  you should be proud of me oh hell if you could only see  that we're gonna grow on up to be  ah yes  we are thick as thieves    oh love it's a brittle madness  i sing about it in all my sadness  it's not falsified to say that i found god  inevitably  well it still exists pale and fine i can't dismiss  and i won't resist and if i die well at least i tried    and we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain  and pour over everything we say we trust  it happened again  i listened in through hallways and thin doors  where the rivers unwind and the rust and the rain endure   the rust and the rain endure. i'm sure.     i am insofar to know the measure of love isn't loss  love will never ever be insofar to know the measure of love isn't loss  love will never ever be lost on me.  love will never ever be lost on me. i hear she's kickin' ass across the board  and rock two hundred thousand higher scorer  just in time to save the world of being taken over  she's a warrior  i couldn't play again because the game  it never end it never even landed on the can  and never let me in to spend my quarter  there's no love for me no more    say it isn't so  how she easily come  how she easy go  please don't tell her that i miss her  because i don't    she was the girl with the broadest shoulders  but she would die before i crawled over them  she is taller than i am  she knew i wouldn't mind the view there  or the altitude with a mouth full of air  she let me down and doubt came out until the now became later    say that it isn't so  how she easily come  how she easy go  please don't tell her that i've been meaning to miss her  because i don't  not for her  it's not that i'm mad to forgive  forget what i said    that i'm crazy like the rest of us  and i'm crazier when i'm next to her  ha    so why after the all of everything that came  and went i care enough to still be singing of the bitter end and broken eras  i told you i don't but  i am only trying to be the best with my intent to cure  the rest is sure to lay me ease the plural hurts of the words of reversepsychology  that's easier said  easier than done  please don't dare tell her what i've become  please don't mention all the attention i have drawn  please don't bother cause she'll feel guilty when i'm gone    because i'm crazy like the rest of us  and i'm crazier when i'm next to her  and it's amazing how she's self-assured  and i know she'd hate me if she knew my words  do i hurt anymore  do i hurt  well  i don't  i don't  i don't his after moan though cries oh no  he's building up a shine but he take it slow  and he knows it time to make a change here and time to get away  and he knows it's time for all the wrong reasons and time to end the pain  but he sleep all  sleep all day  sleep all  we sleep all day over again  why don't we?    she said what would your mother think and how would your father react oh lord  would he take it all back what they've done  no way he said take it  take it and don't break it with your own two hands  that was my old man and he said  if all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it    oh what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie  recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there  going nowhere but for us  nowhere but for the two of us  and we knew it was time to take a chance here  and time to compromise our lives for awhile  and it was time for all the wrong reasons  but time is often on my side and i give it to you tonight  and we sleep all  sleep all day  sleep all  we sleep all day over again    as time goes by we get a little bit tired waking and baked another marlboromile wide  it's sending the boys on the run in the time in hot summer sun  to swim beneath or over outside as they're reading between the lines  then they remember the part in the hallmark card where they read about thedreams  and reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to  and they knew it was time  time to take a chance here  time to compromise our little lives for just a little while  and they knew it was time for all the wrong reasons  as time is often on my side and i give it to you  oh boy  and we sleep all  sleep all day  sleep all  we sleep all day over again    she said what would your mother think and how would your father react oh lord  would he take it all back what they've done  no way he said take it  take it and don't break it with your own two hands  that was my old man and he said  if all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of

your light  your beautiful light?  you've got a paradise inside.  i get hungry for love and thirsty for life   and much too full on the pain   when i look to the sky to help me  and sometimes it looks like rain.    as the sun shines on other people's houses  and not mine   and the sky paints those clouds in a way  that it takes away the summertime   somehow the sun keeps shining upon you   while i kindly stand by.  if theres a light in everybody   send out your ray of sunshine    you're undeniably warm  you're cerulean   you're perfect in desire.  won't you hang around  so the sun  it can shine on me   and the clouds they can roll away   and the sky can become a possibility?  if there's a light in everybody   send out your ray of sunshine you can say that i'm one curly fry in the box of the regular  messing with the flavor oh the flavor that you savor  saving me for last but you better not eat me at all  living in a fast food bag making friends with the ketchup and salt  people say that

day of the rest of our lives  can we just stop and talk awhile  get to know each other  who are we to know?  love could be waiting at the end  'round that bend and so  let's stop and talk awhile

again  daddy  sing me a happy verse.  teach me those clever lines you sang  as you carried me on your shoulders.  sing me that hymn that you so loudly  sang in church with mom.  sing it again to me and fill me  with all your words of wisdom.    comforting words of love when i  would get home from school in tears.  somehow your songs have stayed within me  down through all the years.  once when my younger heart was broken  your shoulder was there to cry on.  sing me those songs i know will linger  long after you have gone.    i am standing at the threshold  of a chapter in my life  i am asking for your blessing  as i'm about to be the wife  of a man i know who loves me  and i'm proud to be his bride.  dad the time has come for me to leave your side.    so  sing me a song again

sheltered in your love  you're where i belong  and when you're with me if i close my eyes  there are times i swear i feel like i can fly  for a moment in time  somewhere between  the heavens and earth  i'm frozen in time  oh when you say those words    when you say you love me  the world goes still so still inside  when you say you love me  for a moment  there's no one else alive    and this journey that we're on  how far we've come and i  celebrate every moment  when you say you love me  that's all you have to say  i'll always feel this way    when you say you love me  the world goes still so still inside and  when you say you love me  in that moment  i know why i'm alive    when you say you love me    when you say you love me  do you know how i love you? the world wanders with me

where to discover my heart    to know if it can love you or not    and it will wander and it will wander  this heart of mine along with you  and the earth will wander  my life will wander and yes yes

with eyes that know the darkness in my soul  shadows on the hills  sketch the trees and daffodils  catch the breeze and the winter chills  in colours on the snowy linen land    now i understand  what you tried to say to me  and how you suffered for your sanity  and how you tried to set them free  they would not listen  they did not know how  perhaps they'll listen now    starry  starry night  flaming flowers that brightly blaze  swirling clouds and violet haze  reflect in vincent's eyes of china blue  colours changing hue  morning fields of amber grain  weathered faces lined in pain  are soothed beneath the artists' loving hand    now i understand  what you tried to say to me  and how you suffered for your sanity  and how you tried to set them free  they would not listen  they did not know how  perhaps they'll listen now    for they could not love you  but still your love was true  and when no hope was left inside  on that starry  starry night  you took your life as lovers often do  but i could have told you vincent  this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you    like the strangers that you've met  the ragged men in ragged clothes  the silver thorn of bloody rose  lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow    now i think i know  what you tried to say to me  and how you suffered for your sanity  and how you tried to set them free  they would not listen  they're not listening still  perhaps they never will...no more talk of darkness  forget these wide-eyed fears  i'm here  nothing can harm you  my words will warm and calm you    let me be your freedom  let daylight dry your tears  i'm here  with you  beside you  to guard you and to guide you    say you'll love me every waking moment  turn my head with talk of summer time  say you need me with you now and always  promise me that all you say is true  that's all i ask of you    let me be your shelter  let me be your light  you're safe  no one will find you  your fears are far behind you    all i want is freedom  a world with no more night  and you  always beside me  to hold me and to hide me    then say you'll share with me one love  one lifetime  let me lead you from your solitude  say you need me with you here  beside you  anywhere you go  let me go too  christine  that's all i ask of you    say you'll share with me one love  one lifetime  say the word and i will follow you    share each day with me  each night  each morning    say you love me    you know i do    love me  that's all i ask of you.    anywhere you go  let me go too  love me  that's all i ask of you    i gave you my music  made your song take wing.  and now  how you've repaid me  denied me and betrayed me.  he was bound to love you  when he heard you sing.  christine  christine.    say you'll share with me one love  one lifetime  say the word and i will follow you  share each day with me  each night  each morning...    you will curse the day you did not do!  all that the phantom asked of you! yes  she looks for me...good  let her look for me  to tell me why she left me  as i always knew she would    i had thought she understood  they have never understood  and no reason that they should    but if anybody could  finishing the hat  how you have to finish the hat  how you watch the rest of the world  from a window while you finish the hat    mapping out the sky  what you feel like  planning the sky  what you feel when voices that come  through the window go    until they distance and die  until there's nothing but sky  and how you're always turning back too late  from the grass or the stick  or the dog or the light    how the kind of woman willing to wait  not the kind that you want to find waiting  to return you to the night  dizzy from the height    coming from the hat  studying the hat  entering the world of the hat  reaching through the world of the hat  like a window  back to this one from that    studying a face  stepping back to look at a face  leaves a little space in the way like a window  but to see it's the only way to see    and when the woman that you wanted goes  you can say to yourself  "well  i give what i give"  but the women who won't wait for you knows  that however you live    there's a part of you always standing by  mapping out the sky  finishing a hat  starting on a hat  finishing a hat  look i made a hat    where there never was a hat you look at me with uncertainty  you look at me with urgency  you look at me with fear in your eyes  like you're about to fall away    don't be afraid to change your colours now  i've known you all summer and you rose above it all  i see you hesitate to fall now  but it's a pretty good view from down here too    when the wind takes you it takes me too  and when you change colours  i'll change mine too  try not to think and i will try too  and when you let go  i will let go too    i knew you when you were green and small  like a feather on a wing  so long  you know i will miss you when you are gone  but don't be afraid if you just can't hang on    cause when the wind takes you it takes me too  when you change colours  i'll change mine too  try not to think and i will try too  when you let go  i will let go too    when the wind takes you it takes me too  and when you change colours  i'll change mine too  try not to think and i will try too  and when you let go  i will let go too    the cold air is pushing hard on you  i know what you're saying  i can feel it too  you'll go through changes and i'll go through them too  don't be afraid now  no don't be afraid  don't be afraid    cause when the wind takes you it takes me too  when you change colours  i'll change mine too  try not to think and i will try too  when you let go  i will let go too coffee is on the table  and i  just can't seem to wake up this aching heart of mine  one more day without you and i'll be fine  i know i'm good for waiting but waiting wasted time    oh and i  i don't take it lightly   the trouble that i've gone through  to get you to know who i am  oh and i  i can't find a reason to be happy in this heartache  'cause i should know better than that  i'm better than that    wicked winds are blowing through the halls  these old familiar faces are clinging to the walls  i know its cold but i can't feel at all  and i know these walls are crumbling  and i won't stay to watch them fall    oh and i  i don't take it lightly   the trouble that i've gone through  to get you to know who i am  oh and i  i can't find a reason to be happy in my heartache  'cause i should know better than that    but i can't stop loving you  i don't know what to do  to keep holding on    oh and i  i don't take it lightly   the trouble that i've gone through  i've given you all that i am  oh and i  i can't find a reason to be happy in my heartache  'cause i should know better than that  oh i'm better than that over mountains and sky blue seas  on great circles will you watch for me?  the sweetest feeling i've got inside  i just can't wait to get lost in your eyes  and all these words that you meant to say  held in silence day after day  words of kindness that our poor hearts crave  please don't keep them  hidden away    sing it out so i can finally breathe  and i can take in all you say  holding out for something i believe in  all i really need today  i want to free your heart  i want to see your heart  please don't keep your heart  hidden away    you're a wonder  how bright you shine  a flickered candle in a short lifetime  a secret dreamer that never shows  if no one sees you then nobody knows  and all these words you were meant to say    held in silence day after day  words of kindness that our poor hearts crave  please don't keep them  hidden away    sing it out so i can finally breathe  and i can take in all you say  reaching out for someone i believe in  all i really need today  i want to feel your love  will you reveal your love  please don't keep your love  hidden away    i want to free your heart  i want to see your heart  please don't keep your heart  hidden away    you  you  you for all the times i tried for this  and every chance at you i missed  i've been known to go my way  but i confess  it made me miss you more    i drew my line across the sand  and set my flag in no man's land  but here i am the one man band  with a song that's meant for two    and there is a light  from a higher window  shining down on you tonight  and the music floats on the breeze  bringing an easier time  and all of our cards are on the table  tell me what you want to do  just don't tell me that it's too late  for me to love you    how perfect we were meant to be  our warm and silent symmetry  it's times like these when all  all we need  is to be reminded    and i have flown a thousand miles  to empty rooms and crowded isles  and we went from cathedral bells  to show and tell and wish you wells  and i  i still look at you and i am blinded i am blinded    because there is a light  from a higher window  shining down on us tonight  and the music floats on the breeze  from an easier time    and all of our cards are on the table  tell me what you want to do  just don't tell me that it's too late  don't tell me that it's too late now  just don't tell me that it's too late  for me to love you shattered dreams  worthless years  here am i encased inside a hollow shell  life began  then was done  now i stare into a cold and empty well    the many sounds that meet our ears  the sights our eyes behold  will open up our merging hearts  and feed our empty souls    i believe when i fall in love with you it will be forever  i believe when i fall in love this time it will be forever    without despair we will share  and the joys of caring will not be replaced  what has been must never end  and with the strength we have won't be erased  when the truths of love are planted firm  they won't be hard to find  and the words of love i speak to you  will echo in your mind    i believe when i fall in love with you it will be forever   i believe when i fall in love this time it will be forever    i believe when i fall in love with you it will be forever   i believe when i fall in love this time it will be forever    this time    i believe when i fall in love with you it will be forever   i believe when i fall in love this time it will be forever  i believe when i fall in love this time it will be forever    and oh that love will call  and if i believe you're the only one for me    i believe  i believe  i believe  when i fall in love  oh  i believe  i believe  i believe  when i fall in love  oh    when i fall    i believe  i believe  i believe  when i fall    when i fall    when i fall in love i've tried to hold this back so long  and we're always such a good thing when it's gone  would it be alright  if we just left our heads tonight    take me away from this old game  of saying that we're both too much the same    would it be alright  if i just stayed with you tonight

yesterday won't let go  every day every day every minute  here comes the emptiness  just can't leave lonely alone  every day every day hey hey  this second-chancin's really getting me down  you give and takin' everything i dreamed about  it's time you let me know let me know just let go      all i ever wanted  all i ever wanted  was a simple way to get over you  all i ever wanted  all i ever wanted  was an in-between to escape this desperate scene  where every lie reveals the truth  baby cause all i ever wanted  all i ever wanted was you    i'd rather walk alone  don't wanna chase you around  every day every day every minute i'd fall a thousand times  for i let you drag me down  every day every day hey hey  your new beginning was a perfect ending  but i keep feeling we've already been here before  it's time you let me know let me know just let go        tell me with so many out there  why i always turn to you  your goodbyes tear me down every time  and it's so easy to see that the blame is on me    all i ever wanted  all i ever wanted  was a simple way to get over you  all i ever wanted  all i ever wanted  was an in-between to escape this desperate scene     i will not make  the same mistakes that you did  i will not let myself  cause my heart so much misery  i will not break  the way you did  you fell so hard  i've learned the hard way  to never let it get that far    because of you  i never stray too far from the sidewalk  because of you  i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt  because of you  i find it hard to trust not only me  but everyone around me  because of you  i am afraid    i lose my way  and it's not too long before you point it out  i cannot cry  because i know that's weakness in your eyes  i'm forced to fake  a smile  a laugh everyday of my life  my heart can't possibly break  when it wasn't even whole to start with    because of you  i never stray too far from the sidewalk  because of you  i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt  because of you  i find it hard to trust not only me  but everyone around me  because of you  i am afraid    i watched you die  i heard you cry every night in your sleep  i was so young  you should have known  better than to lean on me  you never thought of anyone else  you just saw your pain  and now i cry in the middle of the night  for the same damn thing    because of you  i never stray too far from the sidewalk  because of you  i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt  because of you  i try my hardest just to forget everything  because of you  i don't know how to let anyone else in  because of you  i'm ashamed of my life  because it's empty  because of you  i am afraid    because of you  because of you grew up in a small town  and when the rain would fall down  i'd just stare out my window  dreamin' of what could be  and if i'd end up happy  i would pray    trying hard to reach out  but when i tried to speak out  felt like no one could hear me  wanted to belong here  but something felt so wrong here  so i pray  i could breakaway    i'll spread my wings  and i'll learn how to fly  i'll do what it takes till i touch the sky  and i'll make a wish  take a chance  make a change  and breakaway  out of the darkness and into the sun  but i won't forget all the ones that i love  i'll take a risk  take a chance  make a change  and breakaway    want to feel the warm breeze  sleep under a palm tree  feel the rush of the ocean  get on board a fast train  travel on a jet plane  faraway  and breakaway    i'll spread my wings  and i'll learn how to fly  i'll do what it takes till i touch the sky  and i'll make a wish  take a chance  make a change  and breakaway  out of the darkness and into the sun  i won't forget all the ones that i love  i gotta take a risk  take a chance  make a change  and breakaway    buildings with a hundred floors  swinging 'round revolvin' doors  maybe i don't know where they take me  but gotta keep movin' on  movin' on  fly away  breakaway    i'll spread my wings  and i'll learn how to fly  though it's not easy to tell you goodbye  i gotta take a risk  take a chance  make a change  and breakaway  out of the darkness and into the sun  but i won't forget the place i come from  i gotta take a risk  take a chance  make a change  and breakaway  breakaway  breakaway i used to be a little bit shy  i kept my deepest feelings inside  speaking up to you about my emotions has always been hard  but this just can't wait  tonight i feel a little bit brave  so i won't let one more day pass without you explaining what we are    this is gonna sound kind of silly  but i couldn't help but notice  the last time you kissed me  you kept both eyes open  baby  can you tell me what does that mean?  if you're looking all over your shoulder  then you don't need to be with me  and i don't need to hold on      don't let me let me stop you  from doing what you wanna do  you don't wanna stick just me it's cool  take no chance getting over you  no no don't let me let me stop you  if you wanna leave baby you can leave  just don't pretend that you're into me  if it ain't true no  don't let me stop you    a lot of things i can take  got a high threshold for pain  but let's get one thing straight  i'm not down to share you with anyone  if that's not what you're looking for  nice knowing you  but there's the door  'cause i know that i can find someone who'll give me what i want    this is gonna sound kind of silly  if you're looking over your shoulder  then you don't need to be with me  and i don't need to hold on        even if i'm in the brokenhearted  i won't lie  i don't wanna hear goodbye  but either way i'll be alright    [chorus: x2] i woke up today  woke up wide awake  in an empty bed  staring at an empty room  i have myself to blame  for the state i'm in today  and now dying  doesn't seem so cruel  and oh  i don't know what to say  and i don't know anyway  anymore    i hate myself for losing you  i'm seeing it all so clear  i hate myself for losing you  what do you do when you look in the mirror  and staring at you is why he's not here?    you got what you deserved  hope you're happy now  'cause everytime i think of her with you  it's killing me  inside  and  now i dread each day  knowing that i can't be saved  from the loneliness  of living without you  and  oh  i don't know what to do  not sure that i'll pull through  i wish you knew    i hate myself for losing you  i'm seeing it all so clear  i hate myself for losing you  what do you do when you look in the mirror  and staring at you is why he's not here?    i hate myself for losing you  and oh  i don't know what to do  i wish you knew  and oh  i don't know what to say  and i don't know anyway  anymore  no  no    i hate myself for losing you   i'm seeing it all so clear   i'm seeing it all so clear  i hate myself for losing you  what do you do when you look in the mirror  and staring at you is why he's not here?  what do you say when everything's said?  is the reason why he left you in the end?  how do you cry when every tear you shed  won't ever bring him back again?  i hate myself for loving you roll over baby  the time has come  to make a little bit more room  i've hung around you  it's getting tough  i think i'm gonna break down soon    i remember  crying in the park  it was getting dark  suddenly i looked up  you were my sky  so go on and  sleep darling  why don't you pretend we were just a dream  it's cool baby  it doesn't matter anyway  i'm so sorry  we got to the station a little too late  it's such a shame  we just missed the train    be quiet angel  don't make a sound  save it for a rainy day  oh can't you see me  i'm such a mess  trying hard to find my way    do you remember  wasting all that time  we were feeling fine  though we couldn't walk a line  we were alright    so go on and  sleep darling  why don't you pretend we were just a dream  it's cool baby  it doesn't matter anyway  i'm so sorry  we got to the station a little too late  it's such a shame  we just missed the train    oh  why'd that train just pass us by  didn't anyone see  we were stuck at the light  or we would've made it on time    so sleep darling  why don't you pretend we were just a dream  it's cool baby  it doesn't matter anyway  i'm so sorry  we got to the station a little too late  it's such a shame  we just missed the train i felt it  the wire touched my neck  and then someone pulled it tighter  i never saw it coming  i started to black out  and then someone said good morning  i took it as a warning  i should have seen it coming  so now i'll take a chance on    this thing we may have started  intentional or not  i don't think we saw it coming  it's all adding up to something  that asks for some involvement  that ask for our commitment  i think i see it coming  if we step out of that limb    my heart beat beats me senselessly  why's everything got to be so intense with me  i'm trying to handle all this unpredictability  in all probability    it's a long shot  but i say why not  if i say forget it  i know that i'll regret it  it's a long shot just to beat these odds  the chance is we won't make it  but i know if i don't take it  there's no chance  'cause you're the best i got  so take a long shot    i realize that there is all this starting  things we're both scared about  that we'll never see them coming  throw caution to the wind  and we'll see which way it's blowing  and to this pulling on  we'll never see it coming  until it's much to close to stop    my heart beat beats me senselessly  why's everything got to be so intense with me  i'm trying to handle all this unpredictability  in all probability    it's a long shot  but i say why not  if i say forget it  i know that i'll regret it  it's a long shot just to beat these odds  the chance is we won't make it  but i know if i don't take it  there's no chance  'cause you're the best i got  so take a long shot    oh i waited for fact to come of fiction  and you fit my description  i never saw you coming  but we'll make it    it's a long shot  but i say why not  if i say forget it  i know that i'll regret it  it's a long shot just to beat these odds  the chance is we won't make it  but i know if i don't take it  there's no chance  no chance  'cause you're the best i got    it's a long shot but i say why not  if i say forget it i know that i'll regret it  it's a long shot just to beat these odds  the chance is we won't make it  but i know if i don't take it  it's a long shot but i say why not  oh you never saw me coming i hope the ring you gave to her  turns her finger green  i hope when you're in bed with her  you think of me  i would never wish bad things  but i don't wish you well  could you tell  by the flames that burned your words  i never read your letter  'cause i knew what you'd say  give me that sunday school answer  try make it all ok      does

you simply lost your way  she may believe you  but i never will  never again    if she really knows the truth  she deserves you  a trophy wife  oh  how cute  ignorance is bliss  but when your day

to name  you hold your child as tight as you can  then push away the unimaginable  the moments when you're in so deep  feels easier to just swim down  and so they move uptown  and learn to live with the unimaginable    i spend hours in the garden  i walk alone to the store  and it's quiet uptown  i never liked the quiet before  i take the children to church on sunday  a sign of the cross at the door  and i pray  that never used to happen before      if you see him in the street walking by himself  talking to himself  have pity  you would like it uptown  it's quiet uptown  he is working

it's quiet uptown  he is trying to do the unimaginable  if you see him walking in the park  long after dark  taking in the sights of the city  look around  look around  look around  they are trying to do the unimaginable    [verse 3]  there are moments that the words don't reach  there's a grace too powerful to name  we push away what we could never understand  we push away the unimaginable  they are standing in the garden  standing there side by side  she takes his hand  it's quiet uptown  forgiveness  can you imagine?

reasons so don't ask why    i read the story about a week ago  they found her on the beach that night  they thought the light had gone out of her eyes  and no-one thinks she'll ever be right  she was so full of her life  happy with the people she knew  but then no-one can tell    child come away  it's the girl with the deputy walking by  child go and play  no i won't give you reasons so don't ask why    guess all they found were some marks in the sand  a message saying 'she is mine'  nobody touched her as she got in the car  well nobody dares to anytime  she was so full of her life  the girl that everybody once knew  but now no-one can tell    child come away  it's the girl with the deputy walking by  child go and play  no i won't give you reasons so don't ask why    and when they read a story out to the judge  i heard they had to turn away  it's all over town    i saw her face in the back of a car  as they were speeding out of town  she's got a mark on the side of her face  that no-one's ever seen around  and what she is or what she's become  i guess the town will never know    child come away  it's the girl with the deputy walking by  child go and play  no i won't give you reasons so don't ask why i tell ya  it's hell yeah  when love says goodbye it's a four letter word  because your heart knows  when love goes  the feeling is bad - it's the pits of the world  it's sad but true  when nothing you can do  can bring it back    standing in the rain  she starts to cry  is it all a game  she wonders why  why it had to start  why should it end  and take her apart    because she shows it  she knows it  but what can she do  it's a four letter word  because it shakes you  it breaks you  and when it's the end  it's the worst thing you heard  it's over now  and nothing you can do can bring it back    calling out his name  she starts to cry  guys are all the same  she wants to die  hide away the tears  no-one will see  and no-one must hear  but oh    how can the love that she has be profain  and how can something that's so beautiful  just jeckyl and hyde around  it's so sad...    i tell ya  it's hell yeah  when love says goodbye  it's a four letter word  because your heart knows  when love goes  the feeling is bad  it's the worst in the world  it's sad but true  when nothing you can do  can get it back    standing in the rain  she starts to cry  shouting out is name  four letter words well it sounded like a whisper  but soon became a cry  and the moment that i touch you  i know the reason why - we got love  no union is stronger than a woman with a man  i'm gonna give love in the natural way  with everything i can  never mind if things go wrong  you and i will still be strong  and how i love you now    oh baby  we're here tonight  we can make it last forever  wen can make it last for life  oh  baby  no matter what  i'm gonna give love in the natural way  with everything i got    all times it can be gentle  and at times it can be cruel  it can treat you like a stranger  it can treat you like a fool  but tonight i wanna hold you  cos tonight you're gonna see  i'm gonna give you love in the natural way  and keep you here with me  lovin' like you've never known  now at last we're on our own  and i still love you now    oh  baby  we're here tonight  we can make it last forever  we can make it last for life  oh  babe  it's me and you  and it's a natural reaction  when you feel the way we do  what is left that's still unknown  let's discover on our own    cos when love's the culmination  of everything you feel  well it's the only thing that's precious  it's the only thing that's real this is your town  this is my place  this is where my whole world is lived in  nothing much  and just out of reach of all the city lights  it's a high town  it's a low town  it's get here  come on you grow town  no-one does  but everyone thinks they're gonna make it soon  this is one place i respected  now i feel it's really dejected  no-one cares and the people just stare  and a man on the box says  "hey you  don't walk away  vote for me  you'll get more pay  keep working hard"  but they work slow    here it comes now  sunday morning  just another sleepy town yawning  down below everything looks just like another day  but  in the warm glow of the sunrise  there's a child who's searching with young eyes  looking 'round and feeling inside he's gonna fly away  there was one time i was leaving  but the folks around me kept grieving  friends said go  but my dad said no  and my mum kept saying  "don't go  don't go away  don't leave us  you've got to stay  just raise them kids  oh mother no"    no prospects  just projects  don't try to tell me we're living  there's no real need to try  can't you see this town gonna die    hail the new age  it's a rat cage  join the place for breeding dumb spieces  all stacked up and doing whatever someone tells you to  burn the place down  make it dead ground  show the people just what they're missing  wake up  wake up  can't you believe in what i'm telling you  there's a house where i was born in  now it's changed without any warning  cranes just crash and bricks just smash  while a billboard's saying  "let's go  let's get away  come fly me  you've weeks to pay  when sunshine calls  but i won't go    this is our town ten little indians  standin' in a row  all dressed up  but nowhere to go  lookin' for a target  lookin' for a man ........    just get me outta here  it's not the place  my mind's been thinkin' on  just push me out again  it's no use hangin'

flight  but we would soon be together  you'd been gone such a long time  when my radio gave the warning    chaos at the airport tonight  something ain't right  no-one can land in the weather  planes are crashing out of control  and all in all i think you've lost him forever    looking up i started searching the skies  was he still up there above me  was the man who'd waved a million goodbyes  now just a stranger who loved me  but as i drove to the terminal sign  i heard a great loud explosion    chaos at the airport tonight  something ain't right  no-one can land in the weather  planes are crashing out of control  and all in all i think you've lost him forever    i ran so  so fast but if i could only reach you  but you're so far away  you're oh so far away  landing lights approaching  out from a sea of darkness  but you're so far away  you're oh so far away    like a bird of death it hovered around  until the wheels started turning  then i saw the jets just touching the ground  and i could see it recurring  and as i looked for the last time  my radio gave the warning if i live a thousand years or more  you'll still be the one i'm living for  and every night i whisper a prayer  that every day of my life you will always be there  i can't stop the world from changing  i can't say what time may reveal  but i know from now until forever  i won't change the way that i feel  i won't change the way that i feel  about you  baby  if i only have one life to live  i will give you all i have to give  so don't believe these are faithless times  'cause as long as i live  you will always be mine  i can't stop the world from changing  i can't say what time may reveal  but i know from now until forever  i won't change the way that i feel  i won't change the way that i feel  i won't change the way i feel  i won't change the way that i feel  i won't change the way that i feel  i won't change the way that i feel  i can't stop the world from changing  i can't say what time may reveal  but i know from now until forever  i won't change the way that i feel  i won't change the way that i feel  about you  baby  i won't change the way that i feel  i won't change the way that i feel  i won't change the way i feel  about you  baby  i won't change the way that i feel  about you  baby   i had no reason to believe that love was true  infatuation was a game for lonely fools  i wanted freedom but i guess i always knew  you love would entangle my emotions  i feel the power when i hold you close  got to feel you near me  baby  you take me higher than i thought i could go  can't hide it any longer  i need you to know  now i'm touched by your magic  at last i can breathe in all of your love  i couldn't hide from the feelings here inside  'cause i've waited so long  this

down  why'd you leave to find yourself  i can't dance with no-one else  and still there's memories of this town  when you burned this disco down    it's been ten years now this sunday  since you left

familiar noise in a familiar world  its like a million beats in a parisian heart   they're made of glass     working the west with the girls from the east  working a sweat from a million beats  where oblivion stops and oblivion starts   they're made of glass     love makes the world go round  i hold it in my hands  but it slips away   and i watch it fade     love is a mystery  i hear it talk to me  but the words are strange   like it knows my name     love makes the world go round  i hold it in my hands  but it slips away   and i watch it fade     love is a mystery  i hear it talk to me  but the words are strange   were made of glass     it wasn't always easy  it wasn't always fun  we intertwine naively  but in the end we're one    caught in a fairly extraordinary world  it's emotional  where talking it rarely that necessary  and time doesn't count at all    love makes the world go round  i hold it in my hands  but it slips away   and i watch it fade     love is a mystery  i hear it talk to me  but the words are strange   like it knows my name     love makes the world go round  i hold it in my hands  but it slips away   and i watch it fade     love is a mystery  i hear it talk to me  but the words are strange   they're made of glass  count backwards 5 4 3 2 1  before you get too heated and turned on   this guy   you should have learned your lesson all them times before  you've

gender  giving me love that is warm and tender  that's why i gotta tell ya    you and i are of the same mind  it seems to me that we're one of a kind  it's true to say that when love is blind  but then true love is so hard to find  you respect me and the things i do  it was meant to be  i was made for you  open the door to my heart  it's stopped  and i'm shocked....        surrounded by feelings i hardly recognise   i look for explanations i'm taken by surprise.

looking back  i can see the things  i should'a done  could'a done  i see so much of my life i let go by  but when you're young  all you know how to do is wrong  life can play tricks sometimes  you know  you think you got everything  when you got nothing at all  the only way you know where you're going  you gotta take a fall  you've got to lose it all  i've been through love   i'm coming home   i've been through some pain i know   i'm coming home   changes in my life   i'm coming home   now i know what's meaningful   i'm coming home   looking back  i hear my family calling me  all my friends and loves i let go by  they wanted me to stay  but i was on a journey  there are so many faces  there are so many stories i know  but when i opened my eyes i had to realise  there's only one place to go   this time i'm sure  i've been through love   i'm coming home   i've been through some pain i know   i'm coming home   changes in my life   i'm coming home   now i know what's meaningful   i'm coming home   through all the things that i've been through  there's only one thing left to do  this time i'm gonna get it right  uh huh   i've been through love   i'm coming home   i  i've been through some pain i know   i'm coming home   changes in my life   i'm coming home   now i know what's meaningful   i'm coming home   i've been through love   i'm coming home   pain i know   i'm coming home   changes in my life   i'm coming home   now i understand what's meaningful   i'm coming home   so much love  love    i'm coming home   pain i know  pain    i'm coming home   i  i've had some changes in my life   i'm coming home   now i know what's meaningful   i'm coming home   what's beautiful  it's so beautiful  i'm coming home   i'm coming home    i look at all the things i put you through  i've often wondered how it bothered you  i know how close i came to losing you  but we managed to stay alive  i guess only the strong survive  i just gotta tell you baby      sometimes love can be so cruel  sometimes we learn 'bout being a fool  i don't know why  girl  we've lasted so long  it may be the water  that keeps us strong    i took for granted that you'd always be there  i know it seemed at times i didn't care  i didn't know what you had given me  but with love it takes some time  but through the joy and pain  you're mine  i just gotta tell you baby        it may be the water  that keeps us strong  you know that i'm so glad to say  oh baby  that it all turned out this way  ?cause you know that  it almost slipped away  oh baby  but we managed to stay alive  i guess only the strong survive  i just gotta tell you baby        you know that i'm so glad to say  oh baby  that it all turned out this way  cause you know that  it almost slipped away  oh baby  but we managed to stay alive  i guess we found that only the strong survive  so i just had to tell you baby        it may be the water  that keeps us strong so i still walk on through the night and through the rain  i would give it all  just to be with you again    it's a lonely road  for my heart is still in chains  but i live my life just to be with you again    we have walked together where angels go  and we found a place inside us that only we could know    so i still walk on through the night and through the rain  i would give it all  just to be with you again    that's the way life goes  i go whispering the wind  but i take that for  just to be with you again  can i find a reason  can i find a way  cause the words i need to tell you  are the words i didn't say    so i still walk on through the night and through the rain  i would give it all  just to be with you again    i see you standing in the doorway  with that looks in your eyes  and the feeling that i feel will never die    so i still walk on through the night and through the rain  i would give it all  just to be with you again    well that's the way life goes  i go whispering the wind  i would give it all  just to be with you again  it's a lonely road  for my heart is still in chains  but i live my life just to be with you again i walk the land  and release all the way to my shoes  and i sailing the sea's  and watched

sat close enough  that we just barely touched  while roman candles  went soaring above us and baby    then you put your hand in mine  and we wandered away  i was trembling inside  but i wanted to stay  pressed against you there and leave the world behind  on that fourth of july    so starry eyed  on the flowery hillside  breathless and fervid  amid the dandelions  as it swept over me  like the wind trough the trees  i felt you sigh with a  sweet intensity and baby    then you put your hand in mine  and we floated away  delicately lay entwined  in an intimate daze  a crescent moon began to shine  and i wanted to stay  tangled up with you among the fireflies  on that fourth of july    thunder clouds  hung around  so threateningly  ominously hovering  and the sky  opened wide  showering    then you put your hand in mine  and we ran from the rain  tentatively kissed goodnight  and went our separate ways  and i've never truly felt the way that i  felt the fourth of july    truly i have never felt the same inside  like that fourth of july  truly i could never feel the same as i  felt that fourth of july [repeat x8]  give me your love    hey  you gotta bounce to it like this  you almost

and i wish there was a way  for me to trust you  but it hurts me every time  i try to touch you    but i miss you dandelion  and even love you    i gravitated towards a patriarch  so young predictably  i was resigned to spend my life  with a maze of misery    a boy and a girl befriended me  we're bonded through despondency  i stayed so long but finally  i fled to save my sanity    and i miss you little sis and  little brother  and i hope you realize  i'll always love you   always love you   and although you're struggling  you will recover   we're gonna make it maybe   and i miss you little

road  and you can exit if you want why you always..   look at life just like a pessimist  you already like a wife up in my premises  and right ya now you cruise control it is my nemesis  just come

 gotta get on cruise control for the record  you oughta know  you wasn't thinking  when you let me go    but whatever  that's how it goes  win some you lose some  and others you hold in your heart    why it gets so hard  tears you all apart  even though you try to let go  no  no  no    suddenly you're here  and it's so surreal  and i don't know  what the deal      cause when i'm looking in your eyes  feels like the first time  give me one good reason why  we can't just press rewind  i don't wanna spend my life  thinking what it could've been like  if we had another try  one time   like back in the day  that look on your face  feels like  the first time    them other irregularities  they can't compete with mc  the whole entire world can tell  that you love yourself some me    people see ya know  asking all about  me and how they always thought we  were so perfect together    let's re-write the end  start over again  and it's gon go better now        for the record  you'll always be a part of me  no matter what you do  and for the record  can't nobody say  i didn't give my all to you    and for the record  i told you underneath the stars  that you belong to me  for the record  it's obvious that  we just can't let go of us  honey    [chorus: x2]    for the record  baby  now you know  baby oh baby  baby  i stay in love with you    dying inside cause i can't stand it  make or break up  can't take this madness  we don't even really know why  all i know is baby  i try and try so hard  to keep our love alive    if you don't know me at this point  then i highly doubt you ever will  i really need you to give me  that unconditional love i used to feel  it's no mistaking  we're just erasing  from our hearts and minds      and i know we said let go  but i kept on hanging on  inside i know it's over  you're really gone  it's killing me  cause there ain't nothing  that i can do  baby  i stay in love with you    and i keep on telling myself  that you'll come back around  and i try to front like "oh well"  each time you let me down  see i can't get over you now  no matter what i do  but baby  baby  i stay in love with you    na na na na na na na na na  na na na na na na na na na  na na na na na na na na na  baby  i stay in love with you    it cuts so deep  it hurts down to my soul  my friends tell me  i ain't the same no more  we still need each other  when we stumble and fall  how we gon' act  like what we had  ain't nothin' at all now    hey  what i wanna do is  ride shotgun next to you  with the top down like we used to  hit the block  proud in the suv  we both know our heart is breaking  can we learn from our mistakes  i can't last one moment alone  now go i know        and i keep on telling myself  that you'll come back around  and i try to front like "oh well"  each time you let me down  see i can't get over you  now no matter what i do  baby  baby  i stay in love with you        and i keep on telling myself  that you'll come back around  and i try to front like "oh well"  each time you let me down  see i can't get over you  now no matter what i do  but baby  baby  i stay in love with you    i stay in love  love  oh  i stay in love. this goes out to you and you and you  you know who you are    hmm hmm hmm  when glory days turn to stormy nights  you must have been so petrified  didn't you  didn't you feel so cold  you against the world in a losing fight  captive of your demons inside    so you sought an enemy   i'm not your enemy. he lives in you  you know it's true   like times before to mock ignorantly   but the lord said love  love your enemy so just...   take heed to the word it's time  check proverbs 19:29  don't cry    i wish you well  i wish you well  i wish you well    i truly wanted solidarity  still wearing my blinders back then   so much i didn't see   i weep for what i dreamed we all could be  i'll keep you in prayer till the end    still bruised  still walk on eggshells  same frightened child  hide to protect myself   can't believe i still need to protect myself from you   but you can't manipulate me like before  examine first john chapter 4 verse 4    and  i wish you well  i wish you well  i wish you well    be strong in the lord and power of his might    if my shows of gratitude are minuscule  inside your mind  sorry   i'm so sorry  please forgive me   there's only so much i can do i love you and did all that i could    maybe when you're cursing me  you don't feel so incomplete  but we've all made mistakes  felt the guilt and self-hate    i know you've been there for me plenty  maybe still got love for me  but let him without sin cast the first stone brethren  but who remains standing then  not you not i see philippians 4:9   put it into practice and the god of peace will be with you     so  i wish you well  i wish you well  i wish you well     he who the son sets free is free indeed   no weapon formed against me shall prosper  surely god is my salvation  i will trust and not be afraid  the lord  the lord is my salvation  i will trust in him  yes  i know that i know that i know that i know    but i have had god's help to this very day  and so i stand here and testify  to small and great alike  so the more you curse me  the more you're blessing me  the word said it  love your enemies    do good to those who curse you  pray for those who mistreat you  psalms 129:2  they have greatly oppressed me from my youth  but they have not gained victory over me   in jesus' name     i wish you well    he that keeps his mind state on the lord  he will keep them in perfect peace [ja rule]

but we let it drift in a storm  every night i feel the angels cry    c'mon babe  can't our love be revived?  bring it back and we gon' make it right  i'm on the edge  just tryin' to survive  as the angels cry    limitless omnipresent  kind of love  couldn't have guessed it would just stop and disappear  in a whirlwind  here i am walkin' on this narrow rope wobbling  but won't let go  waitin' for a glimpse of the sun's glow    i know i can stand just pull me back up  like there ain't no hurricane it's just us  i'm willing to live and die for our love  baby  we can get back that shine    'cause

september  i've been waiting for somebody like you  to come back around    we would walk in the park  every saturday  brand new  all in love  kissing time away  you was all up on me  it was plain to see  that i was your girl  way back when it was the simple thing  anklets  nameplates  that you gave to me  sweet tarts  ring pops  and that candy bling  and you were my world    now i wish i could go back and make time stop  i would take this love throwback from the top  go dj play my song  and i'm a think about you all night long    back in the days we were in love  were not in love anymore  but some days  i sit and wish we was in one again  back in the days we were in love  were not in love anymore  but some days  i sit and wish we was in one again    it was personal things we would do  things we were to  fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school  now i'm back to the future missing you    my sweet baby  my sweet thang  like candy  felt like real love  not just play play  missing you  my sweet baby    it was everything that i could do  to stay awake  and i often reminisce  about the games we played  it was tag  chess  spin the bottle  then butterflies would last till tomorrow  then the lights came on  i had to run right home    and now i wish i  could go back and my time stop  and i would take this love throwback from the top  go dj play my song  and i'm a think about you all night long    back in the days we were in love  we're not in love anymore  but some days  i sit and wish we was in one again  back in the days we were in love  we're not in love anymore  but some days  i still wishing we was in one again    it was personal things we would do  things we were to  fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school  now i'm back to the future missing you    my sweet baby  my sweet thang  like candy  felt like real love  not just play play  missing you  my sweet baby    i'm a see mimi  felt the need to change me  butterfly flow  like mohamed ali  wish i can bring you back  like the o.d.b  thinkin' bout the world  plus me you and jack  no matter what i do  well the memories are stacked  thinkin' tenth grade  thinkin' 'bout eleventh  when you went doggy fresh  all the way to heaven heaven heaven    back in the days we were in love  we're not in love anymore  but some days  i sit and wish we was in one again  back in the days we were in love  we're not in love anymore  but some days  i still wishing we was in one again    it was personal things we would do  things we were to  fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school  now i'm back to the future

us at our best  and don't forget about      late nights  playin' in the dark  and wakin' up inside my arms  boy  you'll always be in my heart and  i can see it in your eyes  you still want it  so

they say  that you're in a new relationship  but we both know  nothing comes close to  what we had  it perseveres  that we both can't forget it  how good we used to get it    there's only one me and you  and how we used to shine  no matter what you go through  we are one  that's a fact  that you can't deny  so baby we just can't let  the fire pass us by  forever we'd both regret  so don't forget about        and if she's got your head all messed up now  that's the trickery  she'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be  i bet she can't do like me  she'll never be m-c    baby

where i left myself  and lost the will to fight    and the night melts into morning  still it's cold beneath the sun  'cause the fire in me is languishing  and i'm too frozen to run    and every once in a while  there's a distant glimmer of hope  i find somewhere deep inside  someone strong still resides  and i know she's gonna be fine in time    'cause  you see  i've got a lot to dream  there's more than this for me    an angel lands with broken wings  he warms me with his eyes  and the ice that's sheathed around my heart  unravels as he smiles    see i grew up locked in sorrow  so i learn to block the pain  but i won't give up tomorrow  'cause i've come to life again    and every once in a while  there's a distant glimmer of hope  i find somewhere deep inside  someone strong still resides  and i know i'm gonna be fine  that's right    'cause  for real  i've got a right to dream  there's more than this for me    but i keep goin' 'cause every once in a while  there's a distant glimmer of hope  i find somewhere deep inside  someone strong still resides  and i know she's gonna be fine in time    'cause  you see  i've got a right to dream  there's more than this for me   i gotta shake you off  'cause the loving ain't the same  and you keep on playing games  like you know i'm here to stay  i gotta shake it off  just like the calgon commercial  i really gotta get up outta here  and go somewhere  i gotta shake it off  gotta make that move  find somebody who  appreciates all the love i give  boy i gotta shake it off  gotta do what's best for me  baby and that means i gotta  shake you off    by the time you get this message  it's gonna be too late  so don't bother paging me  cause i'll be on my way  see i grabbed all my diamonds and clothes  just ask your momma she knows  you're gonna miss me baby  hate to say "i told you so"  well at first i didn't know  but now it's clear to me  you would cheat with all your freaks  and lie compulsively  so i packed up my

you don't ever have to be in fairy tales   downhearted again  yours and mine   if she hurts you or misleads you   so if by chance you take a listen   baby all you ever need to do   i'm quite sure you "know is call me and let love rush  in that this one's for you    cause i'm giving "my all"    oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  thanx for nothin'    oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh

world around  and they watch  as you're falling down  down  down  falling down  baby    evidently your words were merely lies  reverberating in my ears  and the echo won't subside  there's a deep deep loss of hope  and the anger burns in me  i hope you don't get no ideas 'bout re-uniting baby  'cause that's the last thing i truly need  your audacity is too much to be believed  so  go to mimi on

in my arms under the endless sky  beneath a million stars  within the course of a lifetime  how very young we are    as i stumble on this journey  along the road to what is real  i'm not made of steel  i'm not made of steel    with all the lessons of my learning  and the strength that i possess  still there are mountains i wish i was moving  that take much more than my best    there are plans beyond my power  there are dreams beyond my reach    oh  these eyes deceive the words i speak  don't tell the story inside  so don't believe the face you see  it's only the face of my pride      i'm not made of steel  i'm not made of stone  i can't be anything more than i'm made of  move heaven and earth on my own    i'm only a man  flesh and blood is all i am  you think i can carry the world on my shoulders  that don't mean that i can  i can bend  i can break  i can feel  i'm not made of steel    they teach you well to wear your armor  but what you've learned is just a lie  and there's a price to be paid for denying  with every tear you never cry  don't ever show  don't let them know  the heart you never reveal  don't ask me why  don't make me hide  the pain you don't think i can feel        i'm only a man  flesh and blood is all i am  you think i can carry the world on my shoulders  that don't mean that i can  i can bend  i can break  i can feel  i'm not made of steel    oh  don't believe the face you see  it's only the face of my  only the face of my pride        i'm only a man  flesh and blood is all i am  you think i can carry the world on my shoulders  that don't mean that

keeps me runnin' to you  pleasure or pain  i just can't decide  are they one and the same  it's confusing me blind  am i in love or insane  am i in it for the pleasure or pain    ya make me smile  make me thankful that i breathe  let me taste some heaven  before ya drop me to my knees  ya chain me baby  till it's time to set me free  give me everything i want  give me nothin' that i need    well i ask myself why i keep holdin' on  lovin' you is just a weakness too strong        i still don't understand why i can't resist  what keeps me comin' back  comin' back for more of this  pleasure or pain  keeps me runnin'  keeps me runnin' to you  pleasure or pain  i just can't decide  are they one and the same  it's confusing me blind  am i in love or insane  am i in it for the pleasure or pain    keeps me runnin'  keeps me running to you  i just can't decide  are they one and the same  it's confusing me blind  am i in love or insane  am i in it for the pleasure or pain so you say that you can't go on  love left you cryin'  and you say all your hope is gone  and what's the use in tryin'?  what you need is to have some faith  shake off those sad blues  get yourself a new view    oh  nothing is as sad as it seems  you know  'cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache  someday you'll laugh at the pain  somehow you'll get through the heartache  somehow you can get through the rain      when love puts you through the fire  when love puts you through the test  nothing cures a broken heart  like time  love  and tenderness  when you think your world is over  baby  just remember this  nothing heals a broken heart  like time  love  and tenderness  time  love  and tenderness    i understand how you're feeling now  and what you've been through  but your world's gonna turn around  so  baby  don't you be blue  all it takes is a little time  to make it better  the hurt won't last forever    oh  all the tears are gonna dry you know  'cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache  someday you'll laugh at the pain  you may be down on your luck  but  baby  that old luck's gonna change        baby  oh baby you just need some  you just need some  time  love  and tenderness  time  love  and tenderness  the hurt ain't gonna last forever  time  love  and tenderness  time  love  and tenderness a hundred times i have walked out the door  just to walk back a hundred times more  a thousand nights  i have sworn not to stay  ooh oh  i remained tangles in the chains of desire  ooh  i know that it's no good  i shouldn't be here  i know i should leave you  shouldn't let you close to me  shouldn't have this hold on me  no  i shouldn't be so weak  but a heart can only be so strong  every time i try to go  just one look in your eyes i know  a heart can only be so strong  a heart can only be  a hundred ways you have captured my soul  i can't hold on  but i can't let go  your spell on me is a spell i can't break  ooh oh  all my strength burning in the flames of desire  ooh  i don't wanna stay here  i don't wanna leave you  don't know how to leave you  shouldn't let you close to me  shouldn't have this hold on me  no  i shouldn't be so weak  but a heart can only be so strong  every time i try to go  just one look in your eyes i know  that a heart can only be so strong  a heart can only be so strong   oh  so strong   oh  so strong  i can't let go  so strong  yeah  'cause you're a part of my soul  and i  i can't escape you  no matter how hard i try  i can never be free of your hold on me   oh  so strong   oh  i can't let go  oh  a hundred times  i have walked out the door  just to walk back a hundred times more  shouldn't let you close to me  shouldn't have this hold on me  no  i shouldn't be so weak  but a heart can only be so strong  every time i try to go  just one look in your eyes i know   in your eyes i know   that a heart can only be so strong  shouldn't let you close to me  shouldn't have this hold on me  but a heart can only be so strong  every time i try to go  just one look in your eyes i know   in your eyes i know   that a heart can only be so strong  a heart can only be so strong  a heart can only be so strong   how in the hill did this begin  like some cruel game we can't seem to win  it just goes on over and over again    it took the best outta you and me  i thought we swore we'd let this love rest in peace  am i wrong  didn't we part as friends    how many lifetimes must we live through  'til we're lookin' through the eyes of the truth    we are joined at the soul  with a heart that don't know how to let go  what does it mean when it don't mean a thing  when we say good-bye  but if life is unkind  and forever ain't a place we can find  we'll know how we've tried  and that forever's just a matter of time    so much love  so much pain  no one to judge  no one to blame  it holds on  how desperate this need that remains    we know the passion that leads us blind  'cause the two of us are one of a kind    we are joined at the soul  with a heart that don't know how to let go  what does it mean when it don't mean a thing  when we say good-bye  but if life is unkind  and forever ain't a place we can find  we'll know how we've tried  and that forever's just a matter of time    time after time we stumble and fall  past the point of no return  god knows we've given so much more than our all  to this lesson we may never learn    we are joined at the soul  with a heart that don't know how to let go  what does it mean when it don't mean a thing  when we say good-bye  but if life is unkind  and forever ain't a place we can find  we'll know how we've tried  and that forever's just a matter of time i have often dreamed  of a far off place  where a hero's welcome  would be waiting for me  where the crowds will cheer  when they see my face  and a voice keeps saying  this is where i'm meant to be    i'll be there someday  i can go the distance  i will find my way  if i can be strong  i know ev'ry mile  will be worth my while  when i go the distance  i'll be right where i belong    down an unknown road  to embrace my fate  though that road may wander  it will lead me to you  and a thousand years  would be worth the wait  it might take a lifetime  but somehow i'll see it through    and i won't look back  i can go the distance  and i'll stay on track  no  i won't accept defeat  it's an uphill slope  but i won't lose hope  till i go the distance  and my journey is complete    but to look beyond the glory is the hardest part  for a hero's strength is measured by his heart    like a shooting star  i will go the distance  i will search the world  i will face it's harms  i don't care how far  i can go the distance  till i find my hero's welcome  waiting in your arms    i will search the world  i will face it's harms  till i find my hero's welcome  waiting in your arms in this crazy world  you can prove that you can make it  if you're strong enough to take it  still there will be times  when you find this life you're livin'  is just takin' all your givin'    when you need someone to run to  the shelter of my love is always near  let me be your cover  whenever darkness falls  i'll be there  i'll be there      'til the end of the line  you can count on me baby  call me any time  when the night is fallin' hard  come on out of the rain and into my arms  run to me  to a love that's safe and warm  i'll be yours baby  your safe place fro the storm    people in this world  can be blind and so demanding  show so little understanding  and in these desperate times  seems like everything's deceivin'  there ain't much we can believe in    let me be the one you come to  show you one thing  trust is always here  let me be your cover  whenever darkness falls  i'll be there  i'll be there         run to me  when those cold and troubled winds have found you   come to me  and i'll wrap my world of love around you  i'll be your flame burnin' bright  be the sunlight in your day  that'll take you through the night baby    'til the end of the line  you can count on me baby  call me any time  when the night is fallin' hard  come on out of the rain and into my arms  run to me  to a love that's safe and warm  i'll be yours baby  your safe place  i'll be yours baby  your safe place  i'll be yours baby  your safe place from the storm  i'll be your safe place from the storm we may be strangers  we may be worlds apart somehow  and it's hard to accept  the things we just don't understand  so blind to each other  we only see one side of nowhere  some things we may never know  if there's one thing you should ever know    soul of my soul  heart of my heart  the greatest treasure of my life that's what you are  soul of my soul  child of my heart  i love you more than you know  soul of my

my soul    soul of my soul  heart of my heart  some kind of miracle of my life that's what you are  blood of my blood  light of my life  you mean much more than you know  soul of my soul i've got this somethin' to tell you  there ain't no doubt in my mind  all i'm askin' is to keep you near forever  just till the end of time    baby  i know where love grows  my heart is overflowin'  you're so fine

the best of love  with every breath and every beat of my heart  ain't nothin' finer than that sweetest emotion  just keep givin' me  just keep on givin' me  the best of love  best of love  best of love as i'm looking back in time  my heart was young and the world was mine  driven by desires blind  i remember someone told me as the years roll by  remember one thing  the one thing  people come and people go  the way the winds of fortune blow  so hard to find that heart of gold  i remember someone told me  when you find it  don't let go      you're the one thing  you're the one thing  baby  makes this world heaven  makes the whole thing right  you're the one thing  that means something  baby  the one i believe in  the one thing i need in my life    as i look into your lovin' eyes  there ain't no doubt just where my treasure lies  i've searched the earth for somethin' true  but the only truth that matters is my love for you    and that's the one thing  the one thing  timeless as the stars  faithful as the sea  like the endless risin' sun  i know you'll be there for me  there's so much love inside  this heart of mine could break  'cause i know i've found forever and with every breath i take        and your love is like a rainbow  in a world that's black and white  you paint my dreams in color  and in your arms they come alive  you're my every inspiration  you're the wings that make me fly  you're my only destination  you're the one thing  the one thing in my life  oh  you're the one thing  you're the one thing  baby     here we are  just goin' through the motions one more time  you look into my eyes  but you don't see me  here i am  feelin' like a stranger in your arms  i touch you  i hold you  but lately i don't know you    something is wrong but we go on from day to day  and we just pretend it all away  we act like nothing's changed  but in our hearts we know  it's not the same    chorus  'cause we're not makin' love anymore  baby  we're not makin' love like before  we may hold each other tight  say that everything's alright  but we're not makin' love    remember when  you couldn't wait to run into my arms  when the love inside my heart was all you needed  remember when  you made me wish the night would never end  the fire  the thunder  we lived to love each other    if ever two hearts were one  then it was your and mine  but that was another place in time  now all we have to show  are memories of a dream we used to know    chorus    when did we lose our way  we had it all  don't know how it all just slipped away  but oh  can we get it back again  is it too late  can we try  just one time  'cause darling....    chorus    we're not makin' love anymore  baby we're not makin' love like before  can we find a way to try  find the magic

couldn't love you  the way i always meant to  now there's someone else to play that part    i hope he comforts the child in your heart  i hope he understands the woman you are  and may he never take for granted  the little things that make love work  and most of all  i hope he's all that you deserve    i hear the way you talk about him  and suddenly it's all so clear  it's time for me to learn to

with the one i know  and the seventh thing i hate the most that you do  you make me love you    it's awkward and it's silent  as i wait for you to say  but what i need to hear now your sincere apology

first place  i mean  i  i don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strongthat  i don't know if i'm creating this or this is actually what is meant tobe  and you know that  they say that

ignore  when you call    drive my heart into the night  yeah  you can drop the keys off in the morning  in the morning   'cause i don't want to leave home  without your love  without it    you told me you were coming back  right back   promised it was real and i believed that  but if i fall for it again  i will be a fool  if our love is at the end  then why do i still want you yeah  but i guess i got no valentine  send me roses i just let 'em die  i was crazy thinking you were mine  it was all just a lie    drive my heart into the night  you can drop the keys off in the morning  'cause i don't want to leave home   leave home  without your love  without it    i always knew i never wanted this  i never thought it could happen  it could happen   you acted like you wanted this  but then you led me on  led me on     i thought you would be there when i go  i go   you promised you would be there when i go  i go   but all the broken promises i won't miss  i'm finished  all i know are the facts  that when i look you in the eyes all i see are the lies  been there  done that    drive my heart into the night  you can drop the keys off in the morning  in the morning   'cause i don't want to leave home  without your love  without it hey hey  uh we both lie silent  still  in the dead of the night  although we both lie close together  we feel miles apart inside    was it something i said or something i did  did my words not come out right  though i tried not to hurt you  though i tried  but i guess that's why they say      every rose has it's thorn  just like every night has it's dawn  just like every cowboy sings his sad  sad song  every rose has it's thorn  yeah it does    i listen to our favorite song  playing on the radio  hear the dj say loves a game of easy come and easy go  but i wonder does he know  has he ever felt like this  and i know that you'd be here right now  if i could let you know somehow        though it's been a while now  i can still feel so much pain  like a knife that cuts you  the wound heals  but the scar  that scar will remain    every rose  every rose  every rose  has its thorn    i know i could saved a love that night  if i'd known what to say  instead of makin' love  we both made our separate ways    and now i hear you found somebody new  and that i never meant that much to you  and to hear that tears me up inside  and to see you cuts me like a knife     imagining you're far away  searching for the words to say  i feel it when you fall apart  our lives are our greatest art  i don't want to change your mind  'cause i accept you  for everything you are and will be  stay here with me now    the only thing that our hearts are made of  are the acts of forgiveness and love  the only thing real when push comes to shove  are the acts of forgiveness and love  'cause in the end  no one loses or wins  the story begins again and again  with forgiveness and love    you don't ever have to read my mind  you can see it when you close your eyes  don't believe it when you lose your faith  another moment is a moment away  i can't tell you what the future holds  or how to live  all i know is  what feels right lights up my life again and again    the only thing that our hearts are made of  are the acts of forgiveness and love  the only thing real when push comes to shove  are the acts of forgiveness and love  'cause in the end  no one loses or wins  the story begins again and again  with forgiveness and love    let's jump the sun  let's find forever  where does the time go  just live your life  you'll get another today today today  forgiveness and love  'cause in the end no one loses or wins  the story begins again and again  with forgiveness and love    let's jump the sun  let's jump the sun  let's jump the sun  forgiveness and

acted out   i have questioned sovereignty   and had my share of doubts     and though sometimes   my prayers feel like they're bouncing off the sky   the hand that holds won't let me go   and is the reason why    i will stumble  i will fall down  but i will not be moved  i will make mistakes  i will face heartache   but i will not be moved    on christ the solid rock i stand   all other ground is sinking sand   i will not be moved    bitterness has plagued my heart   many times before   my life has been a broken glass   that i have kept restored   of all my shattered dreams   and though it seemed     that i was far too gone   my brokenness helped me to see   it's grace i'm standing on.    i will stumble  i will fall down  but i will not be moved  i will make mistakes  i will face heartache   but i will not be moved    on christ the solid rock i stand   all other ground is sinking sand   i will not be moved    and chaos in my life   has been a badge of war   and though i have

all around us these days   there are souls that cry so deeply   to fill the emptiness we feel inside.  we look around so hard to try and find   the kind of love we know that will survive.  but here within a heartbeat   is a love that so completely   will take away the fear we try to hide   and even though we often wonder why   he gives us love so strong we can't deny.    if the world lost all it's love   he would still have some to give you!  and if the stars should lose their light   we'd still have his to hold back the night!  this hope is mine   if the world lost all it's love   his still would shine!    hearts in need of kindness   often stumble into blindness   when the dream world and the real world pull apart.  it leaves us with a cold and empty heart.  you'd think that we would know right from the start.    if the world lost all it's love   he would still have some to give you!  and if the stars should lose their light   we'd still have his to hold back the night!  this hope is mine   if the world lost all it's love   his still would shine!    lost inside the hearts we hide   there's hope that he will take us in.  to take away the suffering   and let new life begin.    if the world lost all it's love   he would still have some to give you!  and if the stars should lose their light   we'd still have his to hold back the night!  this hope is mine   if the

her last night  and man she looked like she wasn't gettin' any  oh - rock 'n' roll kind of took its toll  when she shed her inhibitions   too many scenes in limousines  and dressing room intermissions.    she was the queen of nineteen sixty four  but the truth of the matter is  nobody wants her any more.  there was a time she could have shown them how   but nobody wants an over-age groupie now.    when it came to a superstar   jenny was a bragger   she spread it around to everyone in town  that she made it with mick jagger  oh - but there's no doubt  when the truth comes out   true love will always conquer   she didn't get mick  but she got a kick  and a black eye from bianca.    she was the queen of nineteen sixty four   what a pity she became a shadow of the girl she was before.  she passed her prime  it seems a shame somehow   but nobody wants an over-age groupie now.    dwee da da da dwee da da da dwee da da da da   dwee da da da da da da   dwee da da da da.  dwee da da da da da da da da  da da da da da   do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.    i'm afraid that this morning's trade  had a sad obituary   there'll be no more jenny at the door   they took her to the cemetery  just an autograph book and a stereo   there was no one she was close to   she was found with her arms around an elvis presley poster.    she was the queen of nineteen sixty four   tonight there'll be a moment of silence at the troubador.  there was a time she could have shown 'em how   but nobody wants an over-age groupie now   but nobody wants an over-age groupie now.    dwee

"daddy  daddy  what will see there   there's so much that we don't understand"   so i told them of moses and father abraham   then i said "dear children watch the lamb".  "there will be so many in jerusalem today   we must be sure the lamb doesn't run away"   and i told them of moses and father abraham   then i said "dear children watch the lamb".    when we reached the city   i knew something must be wrong   there were no joyful worshipers   no joyful worship songs   i stood there with my children  in the midst of angry men   then i heard the crowd cry out  "crucify him".    we tried to leave the city but  we could not get away   forced to play in this drama  a part i did not wish to play   "why upon this day were men condemned to die?   why were we standing here  where soon they would pass by?".    i looked and said  "even now they come"   the first one cried for mercy   the people gave him none   the second one was violent he was arrogant and loud   i still can hear his angry voice  screaming at the crowd   then someone said "there's jesus"   i could scarce believe my eyes   a man so badly beaten   he barely looked alive   blood poured from his body   from the thorns upon his brow   running down the cross  falling to the ground.    i watched him as he struggled   i watched him as he fell   the cross came down upon his back   the crowd began to yell   in that moment i felt such agony   in that moment i felt such loss   till a roman soldier grabbed my arm  and screamed  "you  carry his cross".    at first i tried to resist him   then his hand reached for his sword   so i knelt and took the cross from the lord   i placed it on my shoulder   and started down the street   the blood that he'd been shedding  was running down my cheek.    they led us to golgotha   they drove nails deep in his feet and hands   yet upon the cross i heard him pray  "father  forgive them".    oh  never have i seen such love in any other eyes   "into thy hands i commit my spirit"  he prayed and then he died     i stood for what seemed like years   i'd lost all sense of time until  i felt two tiny hands holding tight to mine   my children stood there weeping   i heard the oldest say   "father please forgive us the lamb ran away".    "daddy  daddy  what have we seen here?   there's so much that we don't understand"   so i took them in my arms   and we turned and faced the cross   then i said "dear children watch the lamb" they were watching from a distance  and they could not take their eyes from you  you were bleeding  they were weeping  faithful sisters  they had followed you    they did not understand  they could not see  they were mourning their loss  as the sky turned black and the earth turned red  at the foot of the cross    he was standing near your mother  they were so close  they could hear you sighing  all around them angry voices  pierced the darkness and you were dying    but they would not leave  they lingered there  no matter the cost  they were staying and they were praying  at the foot of the cross    keep me near the cross  near the cross  may i never stray so far  that i cannot see what flowed down for me  at the foot of the cross    now i'm standing in your presence  and i cannot take my eyes from you  you have risen  i'm forgiven  precious saviour  oh i worship you    no  i'm not looking back  i've heard your voice and i'm staying here  i've made my choice  for now it's real  now i kneel at the foot of the cross    keep me near the cross  near the cross  may i never stray so far  that i cannot see what flowed down for me  at the foot of the cross    keep me near the cross  near the cross  may i never stray so far  that i cannot see what flowed down for me  at the foot of the cross dare to believe  words by ray boltz  music by ray boltz and steve millikan  you're standing at a mountain  that you know you cannot climb  your enemys approaching  you hear him coming from behind  there is trouble all around you  there's no place to run away  but there's a voice  that's deep inside you  saying it's time to stand in faith  chorus:  i dare to believe  that miracles happen   that mountains still move   and demons must flee  for the god that we serve  he is much more than able  so don't be afraid  stand up and say   i dare to believe  there's a miracle inside you  it's just a mustard seed of faith  but by the mighty hand of god now  you know that tiny seed was placed  and though this world  may try to crush you  it can never keep you down  soon the life of god inside you  will come breaking through the ground  chorus  no matter what the doubters tell you  no matter what the devil says  no matter what anybody   anybody else does  you just keep trusting jesus  you'll see and won't be long  god is right and the doubters are wrong  just say   chorus 2x  no don't be afraid  just stand up and say   i dare to believe  no don't be afraid  just stand up and say   i dare to believe  1998 shepherd boy musicascap  adm. by word  inc.  a division of word music and weedom i pledge allegiance to the lamb  with all my strength  with all i am  i will seek to honor his commands  i pledge allegiance to the lamb    i have heard how christians long ago  were brought before a tyrant's throne  they were told that he would spare their lives  if they would renounce the name of christ  but one by one they chose to die  the son of god they would not deny  like a great angelic choir sings  i can almost hear their voices ring    i pledge allegiance to the lamb  with all my strength  with all i am  i will seek to honor his commands  i pledge allegiance to the lamb    now the years have come  and the years have gone  but the cause of jesus still goes on  now our time has come to count the cost  to reject this world  to embrace the cross  and one by one let us live our lives  for the one who died to give us life  till the trumpet sounds on the final day  let us proudly stand and boldly say    i pledge allegiance to the lamb  with all my strength  with all i am  i will seek to honor his commands  i pledge allegiance to the lamb    to the lamb of god who bore my pain  who took my place  who wore my shame  i will seek to honor his commands  i pledge allegiance to the lamb    i pledge allegiance to the lamb  with all my strength  with all i am  i will seek to honor his commands  i pledge allegiance to the lamb i wouldn't go back  words and music by lawrence chewning  i wouldn't go back  i wouldn't go back  i wouldn't go back  to that life i used to live  i wouldn't go back  i'm never going back again  that's all behind me  so don't you remind me  it's all too vivid in my mind  i wouldn't go back  to that life i used to live  i chose to leave it all behind  lead me on  lead me on  whatever it takes  oh lord  lead me on  i wouldn't go back  to that life i used to live  before the night i knelt  and asked god to forgive me  oh  the pain i felt  the tears i shed   the loneliness inside  i wouldn't go back  i wouldn't go back  not i  i still recall that night one fall  how close i came to ending my life  just before you came  lying on my bed  the ceiling over my head kept screaming   who are you anyway?

home  you knew i loved you madly  and i would gladly  do anything for you    you climbed the stairs to heaven  but you may never climb those steps again  you thought you'd be forgiven  but i was driven to make you understand    i don't want to be your lover  when there's another lover in your head  i don't want to be your lover  when there's another lover in your bed    tell me how you could do it  why put me through it  when you said you'd be true  you said that it was nothing  but it was something  and sometimes that's enough    so climb the stairs to heaven  but you may never climb those steps again  you thought you'd be forgiven  but i was driven to make you understand    i don't want to be your lover  when there's another lover in your head  i don't want to be your lover  when there's another lover in your bed    you climbed the stairs to heaven  but you may never climb those steps again  you thought you'd be forgiven  but i was driven to make you understand    i don't want to be your lover  when there's another lover in your head  i don't want to be your lover  when there's another lover in your bed i don't wanna lose her  i don't wanna lose her    they told me that she had found somebody new  but i don't believe it  they said i would soon find out she was untrue  but i just can't see it    maybe i am wrong to doubt it  and now that i think about it  if ever i lost her love  i'd be nothing  nothing without it    i don't wanna lose her  lose that girl  after all that we've been through  i don't wanna lose her  lose that girl of mine   lose that girl of mine     i couldn't imagine life without her love  i just couldn't take it  if you wanted to know how well i would get on  i don't think i'd make it    maybe i just don't show her  and now that i think it's over  i maybe should shout about it  'cause i'd be nothing  nothing without it    i don't wanna lose her  lose that girl  after all that we've been through  i don't wanna lose her  lose that girl of mine   lose that girl of mine     i'm gonna make a new start  and bring her back to my heart  'cause what i found out about her  i just cannot live without her    maybe i just don't show her  and now that i think it's over  i maybe should shout about it  'cause i'd be nothing  nothing without it my heart starts breaking  when i think of making up  plans to let you go  i keep thinking maybe tomorrow  i'm gonna let you know  but when i think about leaving  i think about losing  the only love i ever knew  every time i think of you    my heart starts aching  my hands keep shaking  and you know  you know  you know    it would take a strong  strong man  to ever let you go  to ever let you go   to ever let you go    my heart's been hurting  when i see you flirting  every night out on the floor  i keep thinking maybe tomorrow  you'l grow to love me more  but whenever we're together  i could leave you never  even though you treat me cruel  every time i look at you    my heart starts aching  my hands keep shaking  and you know  you know  you know    it would take a strong  strong man  to ever let you go  to ever let you go   to ever let you go    i tried to resist you  when you're gone  all i ever do is miss you  anyone in love would know  anyone with half a heart  could never let you go    but when i think about leaving  i think about losing  the only girl i ever loved  can't you tell me why do you hurt me  i guess some people never see  especially a fool like me    my heart starts aching  my hands keep shaking  and you know  you know  you know    it would take a strong  strong man  to

nine  so fly and so fun  and i'm so glad that he's all mine    there's a thug in my life  how am i goin' tell my momma  she's gonna say it ain't right  but he's so good to me    there's a thug in my life  and he's gonna cause crazy drama  and when i see him tonight  i'm gonna give him everything    i know his crew's kinda shady  sometimes it gets kinda crazy  but he's treating me like a lady  gives me everything i need    i don't care whose hatin' on me  'cause every night he's waiting on me  he's got mad personality  a side you never see    my friends tell me to slow down  but every time that he's around  my heart's on lock down  feel loved and i'm so proud    there's a thug in my life  how am i gon' tell my momma  she's gonna say it ain't right  but he's so good to me    there's a

wrong  really loves my company    he's more than a man  and this is more than love  the reason that the sky is blue  the clouds are rolling in  because i'm gone again  and to him i just can't be true    and i know that he knows i'm unfaithful  and it kills him inside  to know that i am happy with some other guy  i can see him dying    i don't wanna do this anymore  i don't wanna be the reason why  every time i walk out the door  i see him die a little more inside  i don't wanna hurt him anymore  i don't wanna take away his life  i don't wanna be  a murderer    i feel it in the air  as i'm doing

 i put in work  did more than called upon  more than deserved  when it was over  did i wind up hurt?  yes   but it taught me before a decision ask this question first:      who am i living for?  is this my limit  can i endure some more?  chances are given  question existing  who am i living for?  is this my limit  can i endure some more?  chances are given  question existing    take off my cool

am  i'd like to think that i'm pretty normal  i laugh  i get mad  i hurt  i think i suck sometimes  but when you're in the spotlight  everything seems good   ooo  yeah   sometimes i feel like i have it worst 'cause i have to always keep my guard up  i don't know who to trust  i don't know who wants to date me for who i am  or who wants to be my friend for who i really am     baby  baby  when we first met  i never felt something so strong  you were like my lover and my best friend  all wrapped in one with a ribbon on it  and all of a sudden you went and left  i didn't know how to follow  it's

i knew that the past couldn't last  for right now  i think i'm running  a race that i know i'm gonna win  and i wouldn't normally do this kind of thing  i wouldn't normally do this kind of thing    if people say i'm crazy  i tell 'em that it's true  let them watch with amazement  say it won't last beyond breakfast  it's a phase he's going through  denigrate or speculate on what i'm going through  because it isn't the sort of thing i would normally do    ask me what   ta ra ra ra   i say i think it's good for you  ta ra ra ra ra   believe it or not  i know where it's all leading to  i feel like taking all my clothes off  dancing to the rite of spring  and i wouldn't normally do this kind of thing  i wouldn't normally do this kind of thing  i wouldn't normally do this kind of -  this kind of thing   i'm the sub-total of my ancestors  i carry their dna  we are representatives of a long line of people  and we carried them around either with  this long line of people  that goes back to the beginning of time  and when we meet - they meet other lines of people  and we say bring together the lines of me    when i look back over the years  at the things that brought tears to my eyes  papa said we have to be wise  to live long lives  now i recognize  what my father said before he dies  vocalize things i've left unsaid  left my spirit unfed for too long  i'm coming home to my family  where i can be strong  be who i planned to be  within me my ancestry  givin' me continuity    would it be remiss to continue in this way  would you rather i quit  come with that other shit  making people's hips sway  lip service i pay  but i'm nervous  i pray for all the mothers who get no sleep  like a lifeline  i light lines  'cause my compassion is deep  for the people who fashioned me  my soul to keep  and this is who i happen to be  and if i don't see that i'm strong  then i won't be    this is what my daddy told me  i wished he would hold me  a little more  than he did  but he taught me my culture  and how to live positive  i never want to shame  the blood in my veins and bring pain  to my sweet grandfathers face  in his resting place  i made haste to learn and not waste  everything my forefathers earned in tears  for my culture    fall back again  crawl from the warm water   for my culture   water to air  you're on your feet again  your feet again.    hello dad

and ease my mind    sometimes i call him up knowing he's busy  and ask if he could get away and meet me  and maybe grab a bite to eat  and he drops what he's doing and hurry's down to meet me  and i'm always late  he sits waiting patiently and smiles when he first sees me  because he's made that way  and if that's not loving me  then all i've got to say    god didn't make little green apples  and it don't snow in indianapolis when the winter comes  there's no such thing as make believe  puppy dogs and autumn leaves  no b.b. guns  god didn't make little green apples  and it don't rain in

night we slept out on the beach alone  you are my thunder  and there's lighting here inside  lighting here inside   once there were times  love when we could touch the air between  and out across this room we'd fill the space with all our skins  and if we just touch hands  life would shine with electric dreams  no matter how many miles  nothing hurt long distance hearts  and there was always something there that space could never keep apart  but now i know inside that something's died  when we're apart  all we have are empty spaces  it's not like we're building walls  too hard to climb to make us blind  it's just so much numbing space to hollow out the heart and mind  and i can hear echoes of ghosts of love  we left behind  i'll always love april  we fell in love and we planted seeds  and now we walk through fallen trees and leaves are crushed beneath  and i will always live in autumn  now we're agreed  all we have are empty spaces  i thought this was meant to be our love had an energy  but only as time evolved and all of our strength dissolved  and we'll never feel the flame that burned so naked again  i walk through kentish town and all the rain  rain pouring down  so many people here but space like this i've never found  and as i get back home and step inside  i realize  all i have  all i have are empty spaces   your pressed your face against my heart  i felt that you could look right through me  we live in days that have no time  we live in times that now refuse me  and somewhere out beyond his town  there lies a world that now can turn us round  and we need it and we need it  oh  got to have some thing to believe in  i've got enough to believe in you  what can i give just to know that it's true?  but i've gotta begin to say  now they've taken my pride in this way  how can you give me your love?  i just can't give you enough  how can you give me your trust  ooh hoo  with a handful of dust?  i feel to thin before your eyes  i feel so naked under open skies  i once stood tall within this town  but now the time has come to bring us down  we must have more with his power in hand  we must believe things will go as we planned  but i've gotta begin to say  now they've taken my pride in this way  how can you give me your love?  i just can't give you enough  how can you give me your trust  ooh hoo  with a handful of dust  with a handful of dust ?

into my heart  i saw your eyes and then i knew  you broke into my heart  like the wind and rain that followed you  you broke into my heart  had the lord above forgotten you?  you broke in from the start  and all my tears belong to you  mushanga  oh  mushanga  oh    i sat and watched as she danced by the fires  through ancient songs did the tale unfold  they sang of diamonds that came from their mountains  and loss of lives mining white man's gold    i had to leave and go back to manhattan  where all my stories are bought and sold  i know the city would surely be saddened  if what i knew

thieves  in a land without learning  only the fools believe    i went driving last night  on a dark canyon road  had the sky to myself  but i wasn't alone    had the pain of my lifetime  for my company  how did it end up like this  for you and me    when love breaks the promise  the heart has to keep  it leaves only truth here to find  when the spirit is crushed  and the hurt is so deep  between you and i    even when love has come and gone  and our hearts have moved along  i will remember  there was a time we had the trust    and that always was enough  i will remember  i will remember you    as i open my eyes to one more day  the wind burns my face  as it whispers your name  as it's pulling me forward    it tears me free  and the only thing left  is the tears for you and me    'cause when love breaks the promise  the heart has to keep  it leaves only truth here to find  when the spirit is crushed  and the hurt is so deep  between you and i    even when love has come

tried to get sideways  across the great divide  but my mind's eye's on the key ring  crying in misery  'cause it won't spend one more evening  staring back at me.    it may be by choice or a small inner voice i can't say  when you add up the cost we all have a cross  how do you write off the loss?    where do i go from here?  how do i find my way?  when is it loud and clear  that there's no turning back? no looking back  where do i go from here?  nobody gets away  it''s a new kind of fix  for the poor and the rich  you never know what's coming next  at the turning point.    the rules are unwritten  and nobody knows the deal  where have i been driven  are deamons behind the wheel?  yeah  i know my days are numbered  we're only flesh and bone  and i've been left to wonder  how it went so wrong.    is it all tailor made  can the sinner be saved  i can't say  so don't hang your hat on the knife i'm my back  'cause nobody treats me like that.    where do i go from here?  how do i find my way?  when is it loud and clear  that there's no turning back? no looking back  where do i go from here?  nobody gets away  it''s a new kind of fix  for the poor and the rich  you never know what's

you wanted  was to be wanted  wish you could go back  and tell yourself what you know now    back then i swore i was gonna marry him someday  but i realized some bigger dreams of mine  and abigail gave everything she had  to a boy who changed his mind  and we both cried    'cause when you're fifteen   somebody tells you they love you  you're gonna believe them  and when you're fifteen    don't

we were both young when i first saw you  i close my eyes and the flashback starts  i'm standing there on a balcony in summer air    see the lights  see the party  the ball gowns  see you make your way through the crowd  and say hello    little did i know  that you were romeo  you were throwing pebbles  and my daddy said  "stay away from juliet"  and i was crying on the staircase  begging you  please  don't go    and i said   "romeo  take me somewhere we can be alone  i'll be waiting  all that's left to do is run  you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess  it's a love story  baby just say yes    so i sneak out to the garden to see you  we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew  so close your eyes  escape this town for a little while  'cause you were romeo  i was a scarlet letter  and my daddy said "stay away from juliet"  but you were everything to me  i was begging you  please  don't go    and i said romeo take me somewhere we can be alone  i'll be waiting  all there's left to do is run  you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess  it's a love story baby just say yes    romeo save me  they're trying to tell me how to feel  this love is difficult  but it's real  don't be afraid  we'll make it out of this mess  it's a love story  baby just say "yes"    oh  oh    i got tired of waiting  wondering if you were ever coming around  my faith in you was fading  when i met you on the outskirts of town    and i said  "romeo save me  i've been feeling so alone  i keep waiting for you but you never come  is this in my head? i don't know what to think"    he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said  "marry me  juliet  you'll never have to be alone  i love you and that's all i really know  i talked to your dad  go pick out a white dress  it's a love story  baby just say yes"    oh  oh   oh  oh    'cause we were both young when i first saw you. this is wrong but  i can't help but feel like  there ain't nothing more right babe  misty morning comes again and i can't  help but wish i could see your face    and i knew from the first note played  i'd be breaking all my rules to see you  you smile that beautiful smile  and all the girls in the front row scream your name    so dim that spotlight  tell me things like  i can't take my eyes off of you  i'm no one special  just another wide-eyed girl  who's desperately in love with you  give me a photograph to hang on my wall  superstar    good morning loneliness  comes around when i'm not dreaming about you  when my world wakes up today you'll be in another town  and i knew when i saw your face i'd be  counting down the ways to see you  and you smile that beautiful smile  and all the girls in the front row scream your name    so dim that spotlight  tell me things like  i can't take my eyes off of you  i'm no one special  just another wide-eyed girl  who's desperately in love with you  give me a photograph to hang on my wall  superstar    you played in bars  you play guitar  and i'm invisible and everyone knows who you are  and you'll never see  you sing me to sleep  every night from the radio    so dim that spotlight  tell me things like  i can't take my eyes off of you  i'm no one special  just another wide-eyed girl  who's desperately in love with you  give me a photograph to hang on my wall  superstar  sweet  sweet superstar  superstar drew looks at me  i fake a smile so he won't see  that i want and i'm needing everything that we should be  i'll bet she's beautiful  that girl he talks about  and she's got everything that i have to live without    drew talks to me  i laugh 'cause it is so damn funny  that i can't even see anyone when he's with me  he says he's so in love  he's finally got it right   i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at night    he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar  the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star  he's the song in the car i keep singing  don't know why i do    drew walks by me  can he tell that i can't breathe?  and there he goes  so perfectly   the kind of flawless i wish i could be  she'd better hold him tight  give him all her love  look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause    he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar  the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star  he's the song in the car i keep singing  don't know why i do    so i drive home alone  as i turn out the light  i'll put his picture down and maybe  get some sleep tonight    because he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar  the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart  he's the song in the car i keep singing  don't know why i do  he's the time taken up  but there's never enough  and he's all that i need to fall into    drew looks at me  i fake a smile so he won't see i took a chance  i took a shot  and you might think i'm bulletproof  but i'm not  you took a swing  i took it hard  and down here from the ground i see who you are    i'm sick and tired of your attitude  i'm feeling like i don't know you  you tell me that you love me then you cut me down      and i need you like a heartbeat  but you know you got a mean streak  makes me run for cover when you're around  and here's to you and your temper  yes  i remember what you said last night  and i know that you see what you're doing to me  tell me why    you could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day  well i get so confused and frustrated  forget what i'm trying to say  oh    i'm sick and tired of your reasons  i got no one to believe in  you tell me that you want me  then push me around        why  do you have to make me feel small  so you can feel whole inside  why  do you have to put down my dreams  so you're the only thing on my mind    well i'm sick and tired of your attitude  i'm feeling like i don't know you  you tell me that you want me then cut me down  i'm sick and tired of your reasons  i've got no one to believe in    you ask me for my love then you push me around  here's to you and your temper  yes  i remember what you said last night  and i know that you see what you're doing to me  tell me why  why  tell me why    i take a step back  let you go  i told you i'm not bulletproof  now you know i'm five years old  it's getting cold  i've got my big coat on    i hear your laugh  and look up smiling at you  i run and run  past the pumpkin patch  and the tractor rides  look now  the sky is gold  i hug your legs  and fall asleep on the way home    i don't know why all the trees change in the fall  but i know you're not scared of anything at all  don't know if snow white's house is near or far away  but i know i had the best day with you today    i'm thirteen now  and don't know how  my friends could be so mean  i come home crying  and you hold me tight  and grab the keys    and we drive and drive  until we found a town far enough away  and we talk and window shop  'till i forgotten all their names    i don't know who i'm gonna talk to now at school  but i know i'm laughing  on the car ride home with you  don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay  but i know i had the best day with you today    i have an excellent father  his strength is making me stronger  god smiles on my little brother  inside and out he's better than i am  i grew up in a pretty house  and i've got space to run and hide  and i had the best days with you    there is a video i found  from back when i was three  you set up a paint set in the kitchen  and you're talking to me  it's the age of princesses and pirate ships  and the seven dwarfs  and daddy's smart  and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world    and now i know why the all the trees change in the fall  i know you were on my side  even when i was wrong  and i love you for giving me your eyes  staying back and watching me shine    and  i didn't know if you knew  so i'm taking this chance to say  that i had the best day with you today. untouchable like  a distant diamond sky

girlfriend  she's upset  she's going off about something that you said  'cause she doesn't get your humor like i do  i'm in my room  it's a typical tuesday night  i'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like  and she'll never know your story like i do'    but she wears short skirts  i wear t-shirts  she's cheer captain  and i'm on the bleachers  dreaming about the day when you wake up  and find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time    if you can see i'm the one who understands you  been here all along so why can't you see  you belong with me  you belong with me    walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans  i can't help thinking this is how it ought to be  laughing on a park bench  thinking to myself  hey isn't this easy    and you've got a smile that could light up this whole town  i haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down  you say your fine  i know you better then that  hey what you doing with a girl like that    she wears high heels  i wear sneakers  she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers  dreaming about the day when you wake up  and find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time    if you can see

you belong with me  you belong with me   why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now  why would you wanna make the very first scar  why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart    maybe i should've seen the signs  should've read the writing on the wall  and realized by the distance in your eyes that i would be the one to fall  no matter what you say i still can't believe  that you would walk away  it don't make sense to me but      why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now  why would you wanna make the very first scar  why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart    it's not unbroken anymore  how do i get it back the way it was before    why would

be without you around    and we know it's never simple   never easy  never a clean break  no one here to save me  you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand       and i can't   breathe   without you   but i have to   breathe   without you   but i have to    never wanted this  never wanna see you hurt  every little bump in the road i tried to swerve  people are people   and sometimes

'cause it seems to me  this thing is breaking down  we almost never speak  i don't feel welcome anymore  baby what happened? please tell me    'cause one second it was perfect  now you're halfway out the door      and i stare at the phone  he still hasn't called  and then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all  and you flashback to when he said forever and always  oh  and it rains in your bedroom  everything is wrong  it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  'cause i was there when you said forever and always    was i out of line?  did i say something way too honest  made you run and hide  like a scared little boy  i looked into your eyes  thought i knew you for a minute  now i'm not so sure    so here's to everything coming down to nothing  here's to silence  that cuts me to the core  where is this going? thought i knew for a minute  but i don't anymore        you didn't mean it baby  i don't think so    oh back up  baby  back up  did you forget everything?  back up  baby  back up  did you forget everything?    'cause it rains in your bedroom  everything is wrong  it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  'cause i was there when you said forever and always    oh  i stare at the phone  he still hasn't called  and then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all  and you flashback to when we said forever and always    and it rains in your bedroom  everything is wrong  it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  'cause i was there when you said forever and always  you didn't mean it baby   you said forever and always  yeah. friday night beneath the stars  in a field behind your yard  you and i are paintin' pictures in the sky  and sometimes we don't say a thing  just listen to the crickets sing  everything i need is right here by my side  and i know everything about you  i don't wanna live without you      i'm only up when you're not down  don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground  it's like no matter what i do  well you drive me crazy half the time  the other half i'm only trying to  let you know that what i feel is true  and i'm only me when i'm with you    just a small town boy and girl  livin' in a crazy world  tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true  and i don't try to hide my tears  the secrets are my deepest fears  through it all nobody gets me like you do  and you know everything about me  you say that you can't live without me        when i'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself  only you can tell    that i'm only up when you're not down  don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground  it's like no matter what i do  well you drive me crazy half the time  the other half i'm only trying  to let you know that what i feel is true    and i'm only me  when i wanna be  well  i'm only me when i'm with you  with you  uh huh  yeah

know what a fool i've been  but if you kiss me now  i know you'd fool me again    last christmas i gave you my heart  but the very next day  you gave it away  this year  to save me from tears  i'll give it to someone special    last christmas i gave you my heart  but the very next day  you gave it away  this year  to save me from tears  i'll give it to someone special    a crowded room and friends with tired eyes  i'm hiding from you and your soul of eyes  my god  i thought you were someone to rely on  me  i guess i was a shoulder to cry on  a face on a lover with a fire in his heart  a girl on a cover but you tore her apart  maybe this year  maybe this year i'll give it to someone special    'cause last christmas i gave you my heart  but the very next day  you gave it away  this year  to save me from tears  i'll give it to someone special    last christmas i gave you my heart  but the very next day  you gave it away  this year  to save me from tears  i'll give it to someone

i'll give it to someone special i was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car  he's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel  the other on my heart  i look around  turn the radio down  he says  "baby  is something wrong?"  i say  "nothin'  i was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"  and he said     our song is a slamming screen door  sneakin' out late  tapping on your window  when we're on the phone  and you talk real slow  'cause it's late and your mama don't know  our song is the way you laugh  on the first date  man  i didn't kiss her  and i should have  and when i got home  before i said amen  asking god if he could play it again    i was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day  had gone all wrong and been trampled on  and lost and thrown away  got to the hallway  well on my way to my lovin' bed  i almost didn't notice all the roses  and the note that said     our song is a slamming screen door  sneakin' out late  tapping on your window  when we're on the phone  and you talk real slow  'cause it's late and your mama don't know  our song is the way you laugh  on the first date  man  i didn't kiss her  and i should have  and when i got home  before i said amen  asking god if he could play it again    i've heard every album  listened to the radio  waited for something to come along  that was as good as our song    'cause our song is a slamming screen door  sneaking out late  tapping on his window  when we're on the phone  and he talks real slow  'cause it's late  and his mama don't know  our song is the way he laughs  on the first date  man  i didn't kiss him  and i should have  and when i got home  before i said amen  asking god if he could play it again  play it again  oh yeah  oh  oh  yeah    i was riding shotgun with my hair undone  in the front seat of his car  i grabbed a pen and an old napkin  and i wrote down our song state the obvious   i didn't get my perfect fantasy  i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me  so go and tell your friends that i'm obsessive and crazy  that's fine!  i'll tell mine  you're gay  by the way    i hate that  stupid old pickup truck  you never let me drive  you're a redneck heartbreak  who's really bad at lying  so watch me strike a match  on all my wasted time  as far as i'm concerned you're  just another picture to burn    there's no time for tears   i'm just sitting here  planning my revenge  there's nothing stopping me  from going out with all of your best friends  and if you come around saying sorry to me  my daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be    'cause i hate that  stupid old pickup truck  you never let me drive  you're a redneck heartbreak  who's really bad at lying  so watch me strike a match  on all my wasted time  as far as i'm concerned you're  just another picture to burn    if you're missing me   you'd better keep it to yourself  'cause coming back around here  would be bad for your health    'cause i hate that  stupid old pickup truck  you never let me drive    you're a redneck heartbreak  who's really bad at lying    so watch me strike a match  on all my wasted time  in case you haven't heard    i really really hate that  stupid old pickup truck  you never let me drive  you're a redneck heartbreak  who's really bad at lying  so watch me strike a match  on all my wasted time  as far as i'm concerned you're  just another picture to burn    burn  burn  burn  baby  burn  just another picture to burn  baby  burn in the heat of the fight i walked away  ignoring words that you were saying  trying to make me stay  i said  'this time i've had enough'  and you've called a hundred times  but i'm not picking up  'cause i'm so mad i might tell you that it's over  but if you look a little closer    i said leave but all i really want is you  to stand outside my window throwing pebbles  screaming  'i'm in love with you'  wait there in the pouring rain  coming back for more  and don't you leave cause i know  all i need is on the other side of the door    me and my stupid pride  sitting here alone  going through the photographs  staring at the phone  i keep going back over  things we both said  and i remember the slamming door  and all the things that i misread  so babe if you know everything  tell me why you couldn't see  that when i left i wanted you to chase after me    yeah  i said leave but all i really want is you  to stand outside my window throwing pebbles  screaming  'i'm in love with you'  wait there in the pouring rain  coming back for more  and don't you leave cause i know  all i need is on the other side of the door    and i'll scream out the window  i can't even look at you  i don't need you but i do  i do  i do  i say  'there's nothing you can say  to make this right again'  i mean it  i mean it  what i mean i    i said leave but baby all i want is you  to stand outside my window throwing pebbles  screaming  'i'm in love with you'  wait there in the pouring rain  coming back for more  and don't you leave cause i know  all i need is on the other side of the door    with your face and the beautiful eyes  and the conversation with the little white lies  and the faded picture of a beautiful night  you carried me from your car up the stairs  and i broke down crying  wish it weren't this mess  after everything and that little black dress  after everything i must confess  i need you he is sensible and so incredible  and all my single friends are jealous  he says everything i need to hear and it's like  i couldn't ask for anything better  he opens up my door and i get into his car  and he says you look beautiful tonight  and i feel perfectly fine      but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain  and it's two a.m. and i'm cursing your name  you're so in love that you act insane  and that's the way i loved you  breakin' down and coming undone  it's a roller coaster kinda rush  and i never knew i could feel that much  and that's the way i loved you    he respects my space  and never makes me wait  and he calls exactly when he says he will  he's close to my mother  talks business with my father  he's charming and endearing  and i'm comfortable        he can't see the smile i'm faking  and my heart's not breaking  cause i'm not feeling anything at all  and you were wild and crazy  just so frustrating intoxicating  complicated  got away by some mistake and now    i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain  and it's two a.m. and i'm cursing your name  i'm so in love that i acted insane  and that's the way i loved you  breakin' down and coming undone  it's a roller coaster kinda rush  and i never knew i could feel that much  and that's the way i loved you    and that's the way i loved you oh  oh  never knew i could feel that much  and that's the way i loved you he said the way my blue eyes shined  put those georgia stars to shame that night  i said: "that's a lie."  just a boy in a chevy truck  that had a tendency of gettin' stuck  on back roads at night  and i was right there beside him all summer long  and then the time we woke up to find that summer had gone    but when you think "tim mcgraw"  i hope you think my favorite song  the one we danced to all night long  the moon like a spotlight on the lake  when you think happiness  i hope you think "that little black dress"  think of my head on your chest  and my old faded blue jeans  when you think tim mcgraw  i hope you think of me    september saw a month of tears  and thankin' god that you weren't here  to see me like that  but in a box beneath my bed  is a letter that you never read  from three summers back  it's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet  and lookin' back on all of that  it's nice to believe    but when you think "tim mcgraw"  i hope you think my favorite song  the one we danced to all night long  the moon like a spotlight on the lake  when you think happiness  i hope you think "that little black dress"  think of my head on your chest  and my old faded blue jeans  when you think tim mcgraw  i hope you think of me    and i'm back for the first time since then  i'm standin' on your street  and there's a letter left on your doorstep  and the first thing that you'll read    is when you think "tim mcgraw"  i hope you think my favorite song  someday you'll turn your radio on  i hope it takes you back to that place  when you think happiness  i hope you think "that little black dress"  think of my head on your chest  and my old faded blue jeans  when you think tim mcgraw  i hope you think of me    oh  think of me  mmm    you said the way my blue eyes shined  put those georgia stars to shame that night  i said  "that's a lie." say you're sorry  that face of an angel  comes out just when you need it to  as i paced back and forth all this time  'cause i honestly believed in you  holding on  the days drag on  stupid girl   i should have known  i should have known    that i'm not a princess  this ain't a fairy tale  i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet   lead her up the stairwell  this ain't hollywood  this is a small town   i was a dreamer before you went and let me down  now it's too late for you  and your white horse  to come around    baby i was naive   got lost in your eyes  and never really had a chance  my mistake i didn't know to be in love  you had to fight to have the upper hand  i had so many dreams  about you and me  happy endings  now i know    i'm not a princess  this ain't a fairy tale  i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet   lead her up the stairwell  this ain't hollywood  this is a small town   i was a dreamer before you went and let me down  now it's too late for you  and your white horse  to come around    and there you are on

actually treat me well  this is a big world  that was a small town  there in my rear view mirror disappearing now  and its too late for you and your white horse  now its too late for you and your

everything has changed  all i know is a new found grace  all my days  i'll know your face  all i know since yesterday is everything has changed once upon time  a few mistakes ago  i was in your sights  you got me alone  you found me  you found me  you found me    i guess you didn't care  and i guess i liked that  and when i fell hard  you took a step back  without me  without me  without me    and he's long gone  when he's next to me  and i realize the blame is on me    'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in  so shame on me now  flew me to places i'd never been  so you put me down oh  i knew you were trouble when you walked in  so shame on me now  flew me to places i'd never been  now i'm lying on the cold hard ground  oh  oh  trouble  trouble  trouble  oh  oh  trouble  trouble  trouble    no apologies  he'll never see you cry  pretend he doesn't know  that he's the reason why  you're drowning  you're drowning  you're drowning    and i heard you moved on  from whispers on the street  a new notch in your belt  is all i'll ever be  and now i see  now i see  now i see  he was long gone  when he met me  and i realize the joke is on me    i knew you were trouble when you walked in  so shame on me now  flew me to places i'd never been  so you put me down oh  i knew you were trouble when you walked in  so shame on me now  flew me to places i'd never been  now i'm lying on the cold hard ground  oh  oh  trouble  trouble  trouble  oh  oh  trouble  trouble  trouble    when your saddest fear comes creeping in  that you never loved me or her or anyone or anything  yeah    i knew you were trouble when you walked in  so shame on me now  flew me to places i'd never been  so you put me down oh  i knew you were trouble when you walked in  so shame on me now  flew me to places i'd never been  now i'm lying on the cold hard ground  oh  oh  trouble  trouble  trouble  oh  oh  trouble  trouble  trouble    i knew you were trouble when you walked in  trouble  trouble  trouble  i knew you were trouble when you walked in  trouble  trouble  trouble i still remember the look on your face  lit through the darkness at 1:58  the words that you whispered  for just us to know  you told me you loved me  so why did you go  away  away    i do recall now  the smell of the rain  fresh on the pavement  i ran off the plane  that july ninth  the beat of your heart  it jumps through your shirt  i can still feel your arms    but now i'll go sit on the floor  wearing your clothes  all that i know is  i don't know how to be something you missed  never thought we'd have a last kiss  never imagined we'd end like this  your name  forever the name on my lips    i do remember  the swing in your step  the life of the party  you're showing off again  and i roll my eyes and then  you pull me in  i'm not much for dancing  but for you i did    because i love your handshake  meetin' my father  i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets  how you kissed me when i was in the middle of saying something  there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions    and i'll go sit on the floor  wearing your clothes  all that i know is that  i don't know how to be something you miss  never thought we'd have a last kiss  never imagined we'd end like this  your name  forever the name on my lips    so i'll watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep  and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe  and i'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are  hope it's nice where you are    and i hope the sun shines  and it's a beautiful day  and something reminds you  you wish you had stayed  you can plan for a change in weather and time  but i never planned on you changing your mind    so i'll go sit on the floor  wearing your clothes  all that i know is that  i don't know how to be something you miss  never thought we'd have a last kiss  never imagined we'd end like this  your name  forever the name on my lips    just like our last kiss  forever the name on my lips  forever the name on my lips  just like our last i said remember this moment  in the back of my mind  the time we stood with our shaking hands  the crowds in stands went wild  we were the kings and the queens  and they read off our names  the night you danced like you knew our lives  would never be the same  you held your head like a hero  on a history book page  it was the end of a decade  but the start of an age    long live the walls we crashed through  all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  i was screaming  "long live all the magic we made"  and bring on all the pretenders  one day we will be remembered    i said remember this feeling  i passed the pictures around  of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines  wishing for right now  we are the kings and the queens  you traded your baseball cap for a crown  when they gave us our trophies  and we held them up for our town  and the cynics were outraged  screaming  "this is absurd"  'cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world    long live the walls we crashed through  all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  i was screaming  "long live all the magic we made"  and bring on all the pretenders  i'm not afraid    long live all the mountains we moved  i had the time of my life  fighting dragons with you  i was screaming  "long live the look on your face"  and bring on all the pretenders  one day we will be remembered    hold on to spinning around  confetti falls to the ground  may these memories break our fall    can you take a moment  promise me this:  that you'll stand by me forever  but if god forbid fate should step in  and force us into a goodbye  if you have children someday  when they point to the pictures  please tell them my name  tell them how the crowds went wild  tell them how i hope they shine    long live the walls we crashed through  i had the time of my life with you    long  long live the walls we crashed through  all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you  and i was screaming  "long live all the magic we made"  and bring on all the pretenders  i'm not afraid    singing long live all the mountains we moved  i had the time of my life  fighting dragons with you  and long  long live the look on your face  and bring on all the pretenders  one day  we will be remembered you  with your words like knives  and swords and weapons that you use against me  you  have knocked me off my feet again   got me feeling like a nothing  you  with your voice like nails  on a chalk board  calling me out when i'm wounded  you  picking on the weaker man    you can take me down  with just one single blow  but you don't know what you don't know    someday i'll be living in a big old city  and all you're ever gonna be is mean  someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me  and all you're ever gonna be is mean  why you gotta be so mean?    you  with your switching sides  and your wildfire lies and your humiliation  you have pointed out my flaws again  as if i don't already see them  i walk with my head down   try to block you out 'cause i never impress you  i just want to feel okay again    i bet you got pushed around  somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now  'cause you can't lead me down that road  and you don't know what you don't know    someday i'll be living in a big old city  and all you're ever gonna be is mean  someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me  and all you're ever gonna be is mean  why you gotta be so mean?    and i can see you years from now in a bar  talking over a football game  with that same big loud opinion  but nobody's listening  washed up and ranting  about the same old bitter things  drunk and rumbling on about how i can't sing  but all you are is mean  all you are is mean and a liar and pathetic  and alone in life and mean  and mean  and mean  and mean    but someday i'll be living in a big old city  and all you're ever gonna be is mean  yeah someday i'll be big enough  so you can't hit me  and all you're ever gonna be is mean  why you gotta be so  mean   someday i'll be living in a big old city   why you gotta be so mean     and all you're ever gonna be is mean   why you gotta be so mean   someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me   why you gotta be so mean   and all you're ever gonna be is mean  why you gotta be so mean? elevator buttons and morning air   strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs   if you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares   but right now   my time is theirs.    seems like there's always  someone who disapproves   they'll judge it like they know about me and you   and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do   the jury's out   and my choice is you.    so don't you worry your pretty little mind   people throw rocks at things that shine   and life makes love look hard   the stakes are high   the waters rough   but this love is ours     you never know what people have up their sleeves   ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me   lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles   but i don't care   'cause right now you're mine   and you say     so don't you worry your pretty little mind   people throw rocks at things that shine   and life makes love look hard   the stakes are high   the water's rough   but this love is ours    and it's not theirs to speculate   if it's wrong and   your hands are tough but they are where   my belong in   i'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you.    'cause i love the gap between your teeth   and i love the riddles that you speak   and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored   'cause my heart is yours.    so don't you worry your pretty little mind   people throw rocks at things that shine   and life makes love look hard     and don't you worry your pretty little mind   people throw rocks at things that shine   but they can't take what's ours   they can't take what's ours   the stakes are high   the water's rough   but this love is ours. i'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night  i threw my phone across the room at you  i was expecting some dramatic turn away  but you stayed  this morning i said we should talk about it  'cause i read you should never leave a fight unresolved  that's when you came in wearing a football helmet  and said okay  let's talk  and i said    stay  stay  stay  i've been loving you for quite some time  time  time  you think that it's funny when i'm mad  mad  mad  but i

nowhere to hide  just you and me    this is the last time i'm asking you this  put my name at the top of your list  this is the last time i'm asking you why  you break my heart in the blink of an eye

gotta have you  i gotta have you i walked through the door with you  the air was cold  but something about it felt like home somehow  and i left my scarf there at your sister's house  and you still got it in your drawer  even now    oh  your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze  we're singing in the car getting lost upstate  autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place  and i can picture it after all these days    and i know it's long gone  and that magic's not here no more  and i might be okay  but i'm not fine at all    'cause there we are again  on that little town street  you almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me  wind in my hair  i was there  i remember it all too well    photo album on the counter  your cheeks were turning red  you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed  your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team  you tell me about your past  thinking your future was me    and i know it's long gone  and there's nothing else i could do  and i forget about you long enough  to forget why i needed to    'cause there we are again  in the middle of the night  we're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light  down the stairs  i was there  i remember it all too well    and maybe we got lost in translation  maybe i asked for too much  but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up  running scared  i was there  i remember it all too well    and you call me up again just to break me like a promise  so casually cruel in the name of being honest  i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here  'cause i remember it all  all  all too well    time won't fly  it's like i'm paralyzed by it  i'd like to be my old self again  but i'm still trying to find it  after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own  now you mail back my things and i walk home alone    but you keep my old scarf from that very first week  'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me  you can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well  yeah    'cause there we are again  when i loved you so  back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known  it was rare  i was there  i remember it all too well    wind in my hair  you were there  you remember it all  down the stairs  you were there  you remember it all  it was rare  i was there  i remember it all to well i'm so glad you made time to see me.  how's life  tell me how's your family?  i haven't seen them in a while.  you've been good  busier then ever.  we small talk  work and the weather  your guard is up and i know why.    because the last time you saw me  is still burned in the back of your mind.  you gave me roses and i left them there to die.    so this is me swallowing my pride   standing in front of you saying i'm sorry for that night.  and i go back to december all the time.  it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you   wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine.  i'd go back to december  turn around and make it all right.  i go back to december all the time.    these days i haven't been sleeping  staying up playing back myself leaving   when your birthday passed and i didn't call.  and i think about summer  all the beautiful times  i watched you laughing from the passenger side  and realized i'd loved you in the fall.  and then the cold came  the dark days when fear crept into my mind.  you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye.    so this is me swallowing my pride   standing in front of you saying i'm sorry for that night.  and i go back to december all the time.  it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you   wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine.  i'd go back to december turn around and change my own mind.  i go back to december all the time    i miss your tan skin  your sweet smile  so good to me  so right   and how you held me in your arms that september night   the first time you ever saw me cry.  maybe this is wishful thinking   probably mindless dreaming  but if we loved again i swear i'd love you right.    i'd go back in time and change it but i can't  so if the chain is on your door  i understand.    but this is me swallowing my pride   standing in front of you saying i'm sorry for that night   and i go back to december.  it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you   wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine.  i'd go back to december turn around and make it all right.  i'd go back to december turn around and change my own mind.  i go back to december all the time all the time her hair

catch your flight   right when i was just about to fall    i told myself don't get attached   but in my mind i play it back   spinning faster than the plane that took you     and this is when the feeling sinks in   i don't wanna miss you like this   come back  be here  come back  be here.  i guess you're in new york today   i don't wanna need you this way   come back  be here  come back  be here.    the delicate beginning rush   the feeling you can know so much   without knowing anything at all.  and now that i can put this down   if i had known what i know now   i never would have played so nonchalant.    taxi cabs and busy streets   that never bring you back to me   i can't help but wish you took me with you     and this is when the feeling sinks in   i don't wanna miss you like this   come back  be here  come back  be here.  i guess you're in london today   and i don't wanna need you this way   come back  be here  come back  be here.    this is falling in love in the cruelest way   this is falling for you and you are worlds away.    new york  be here.  but you're in london and i break down   'cause it's not fair that you're not around.    this is when the feeling sinks in   i don't wanna miss you like this   come back  be here  come back  be here.  i guess you're in new york today   and i don't wanna need you this way   come back  be here  come back  be here.    i don't wanna miss you like this.  come back  be here.  come back  be here. long were the nights when my days once revolved around you  counting my footsteps   praying the floor won't fall through  again  my mother accused me of losing my mind   but i swore i was fine  you paint me a blue sky  and go back and turn it to rain  and i lived in your chess game   but you changed the rules every day  wondering which version of you i might get on the phone  tonight  well i stopped picking up  and this song is to let you know why    dear john  i see it all now that you're gone  don't you think i was too young to be messed with?  the girl in the dress  cried the whole way home  i should've known    well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame  maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away  and you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand  and i'll look back and regret how i ignored when they said "run as fast as youcan"    dear john  i see it all now that you're gone  don't you think i was too young to be messed with?  the girl in the dress  cried the whole way home    dear john  i see it all  now it was wrong  don't you think nineteen is too young  to be played by your dark twisted games  when i loved you so?  i should've known    you are an expert at sorry   and keeping the lines blurry  never impressed by me acing your tests  all the girls that you've run dry  have tired  lifeless eyes  'cause you burned them out  but i took your matches before fire could catch me   so don't look now  i'm shining like fireworks over your sad  empty town    dear john  i see it all now that you're gone  don't you think i was too young to be messed with?  the girl in the dress  cried the whole way home.    i see it all now that you're gone  don't you think i was too young to be messed with?  the girl in the dress wrote you a song  you should've known  you should've known  don't you think i was too young? you should've known there i was again tonight forcing laughter  faking smiles  same old tired  lonely place  walls of insincerity  shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when i saw your face  all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you    your eyes whispered "have we met?"  across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me  the playful conversation starts  counter all your quick remarks  like passing notes in secrecy  and it was enchanting to meet you  all i can say is i was enchanted to meet you    this night is sparkling  don't you let it go  i'm wonder struck  blushing all the way home  i'll spend forever wondering if you knew  i was enchanted to meet you    the lingering question kept me up  two a.m.  who do you love?  i wonder till i'm wide awake  now i'm pacing back and forth  wishing you were at my door  i'd open up and you would say  hey  it was enchanting to meet you  all i know is i was  enchanted to meet you    this night is sparkling  don't you let it go  i'm wonder struck  blushing all the

responsibility   to do what's upstanding and right   it's kinda like a code  yeah   and you've been getting closer and closer   and crossing so many lines.    and it would be a fine proposition   if i was a stupid girl   but honey i am no-one's exception   this i have previously learned.    so don't look at me   you've got a girl at home   and everybody knows that   everybody knows that   ah ah

newest thing   and take for granted what you have.    and it would be a fine proposition   if i was a stupid girl   and yeah i might go with it   if i hadn't once been just like her.    don't look at

 six months gone and i'm still reaching  even though i know you're not there  i was playing back a thousand memories  baby  thinking 'bout everything we've been through  maybe i've been going back too much lately  when time stood still and i had you    come back  come back  come back to me like  you would  you would if this was a movie  stand in the rain outside 'til i came out  come back  come back  come back to me like  you could  you could if you just said you're sorry  i know that we could work it out somehow  but if this was a movie you'd be here by now    i know people change and these things happen  but i remember how it was back then  locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing  'cause nothing like this ever happened to them   now i'm pacing up the hall  chasing down your street  flashback to a night when you said to me   "nothing's gonna change  not for me and you  not before i knew how much i had to lose"    come back  come back  come back to me like  you would  you would if this was a movie  stand in the rain outside 'til i came out  come back  come back  come back to me like  you could  you could if you just said you're sorry  i know that we could work it out somehow  but if this was a movie you'd be here by now    if you're out there  if you're somewhere  if you're moving on  i'll be waiting for you  wary  since you've been gone  i just want it back the way it was before  and i just want to see you back at my front door  and i say    come back  come back  come back to me like  you would before you say it's not that easy  before the fight  before i locked you out  but i take it all back now  come back  come back  come back to me like  you would  you would if this was a movie  stand in the rain outside 'til i came out  come back  come back  come back to me like  you could  you could if you just said you're sorry  i know that we could work it out somehow  but if this was a movie you'd be here by now    you'd be here by now  it's not the kind of ending you wanna see now  baby  i don't like the ending  oh  i thought you'd be here now  whoa  thought you'd be here by now i guess you really did it this time  left yourself in your warpath  lost your balance on a tightrope  lost your mind tryin' to get it back    wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?  always a bigger bed to crawl into  wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?  and everybody believed in you?    it's alright  just wait and see  your string of lights is still bright to me  oh  who you are is not where you've been  you're still an innocent  you're still an innocent    did some things you can't speak of  but at night you'll live it all again  you wouldn't be shattered on the floor now  if only you had seen what you know now then    wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?  and everything out of reach  someone bigger brought down to you  wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep?  before the monsters caught up to you?    it's alright  just wait and see  your string of lights is still bright to me  oh  who you are is not where you've been  you're still an innocent    it's okay  life is a tough crowd  thirty two is still growin' up now  who you are is not what you did  you're still an innocent    time turns flames to embers  you'll have new septembers  every one of us has messed up too    lives change like the weather  i hope you remember  today is never too late to  be brand new    it's all right  just wait and see  your string of lights are still bright to me  oh  who you are is not where you've been  you're still an innocent    it's okay  life is a tough crowd  thirty two  is still growin' up now  who you are is not what you did  you're still an innocent  you're still an innocent    lost your balance on a tight rope  oh  it's never too late to get it back oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh    you were in college  working part-time  waiting tables  left a small town  never looked back  i was a flight risk  with a fear of fallin'  wondering why we bother with love  if it never lasts    i say  "can you believe it?"  as we're lyin' on the couch  the moment  i can see it  yes  yes  i can see it now    do you remember  we were sittin'  there by the water?  you put your arm around me for the first time  you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  you are the best thing  that's ever been mine    flash forward  and we're takin' on the world together  and there's a drawer of my things at your place  you learn my secrets and you figure out why i'm guarded  you say we'll never make my parents' mistakes    and we got bills to pay  we got nothin' figured out  when it was hard to take  yes  yes  this is what i thought about    do you remember  we were sittin' there  by the water?  you put your arm around me  for the first time  you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  you are the best thing  that's ever been mine    do you remember all the city lights on the water?  you saw me start to believe  for the first time  you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  you are the best thing  that's ever been mine    oh  oh  oh  oh    and i remember that fight  two-thirty a.m.  'cause everything was slipping right out of our hands  i ran out  crying  and you followed me out into the street    braced myself for the goodbye   'cause that's all i've ever known  then  you took me by surprise  you said  "i'll never leave you alone"    you said  "i remember how we felt  sitting by the water.  and every time i look at you  it's like the first time.  i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter.  she is the best thing that's ever been mine."    you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  you are the best thing  that's ever been mine    do you believe it?  we're gonna make it now  and i can see it     i can see it now  your little hands wrapped around my finger  and it's so quiet in the world tonight  your little eyelids flutter cause

so bright just before they lose it all    losing him was blue like i'd never known  missing him was dark grey all alone  forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  but loving him was red  loving him was red    touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in frontof you  memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song  fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there'sno right answer  regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be thatstrong    losing him was blue like i'd never known  missing him was dark gray all alone  forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  but loving him was red  oh red  burning red    remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes  tell myself it's time now  gotta let go  but moving on from him is impossible  when i still see it all in my head  burning red  burning it was red    oh losing him was blue like i'd never known  missing him was dark gray all alone  forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  'cause loving him was red  yeah  yeah red  we're burning red    and that's why he's spinning 'round in my head  comes back to me  burning red  yeah  yeah  his love was like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street i remember your bare feet down the hallway  i remember your little laugh  race cars on the kitchen floor  plastic dinosaurs  i love you to the moon and back    i remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club  i remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up  i can still feel you hold my hand  little man  from even that moment i knew  you fought it hard like an army guy  remember i leaned in and whispered to you    come on baby with me  we're gonna fly away from here  you were my best four years    i remember the drive home when the blind hope  turned to crying and screaming  "why?"  flowers piled up in the worst way  no one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died    and it's about to be halloween  you could be anything you wanted if you were still here    i remember the last day when i kissed your face  i whispered in your ear    come on baby with me  we're gonna fly away from here  out of this curtained room in this hospital  we'll just disappear  come on baby with me  we're gonna fly away from here  you were my best four years    what if i'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?  what if i kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?  and what if i really thought some miracle would see us through?  but what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you    come on baby with me  we're gonna fly away from here  come on baby with me  we're gonna fly away from here  you were my best four years    i remember your bare feet down the hallway  i love you to the moon and back the way you move is like a full on rainstorm  and i'm a house of cards  you're the kind of reckless that should send me running  but i kinda know that i won't get far    and you stood there in front of me just  close enough to touch  close enough to hope you couldn't see  what i was thinking of    drop everything now  meet me in the pouring rain  kiss me on the sidewalk  take away the pain  'cause i see  sparks fly  whenever you smile    get me with those green eyes  baby  as the lights go down  gimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around  'cause i see  sparks fly  when you smile    my mind forgets to remind me  your a bad idea  you touch me once and it's

lights go down  gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around  'cause i see  sparks fly  whenever you smile    i run my fingers through your hair  and watch the lights go wild  just keep on

bargin' in on a white veil occasion   but you are not the kind of boy   who should be marryin' the wrong girl    i sneak in and see your friends   and her snotty little family  all dressed in pastel   and she is yelling at a bridesmaid   somewhere back inside a room   wearing a gown shaped like a pastry   this is surely not what you thought it would be   i lose myself in a daydream   where i stand and say    "don't say yes  run away now   i'll meet you when you're out   of the church at the back door   don't wait or say a single vow   you need to hear me out "  and they said  "speak now"    fond gestures are exchanged   and the organ starts to play  a song that sounds like a death march   and i am hiding in the curtains   it seems i was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be   she floats down the aisle like a pageant queen   but i know you wish it was me   you wish it was me  don't you?    don't say yes  run away now   i'll meet you when you're out   of the church at the back door   don't wait or say a single vow   you need to hear me out   and they said  "speak now"    don't say yes  run away now   i'll meet you when you're out   of the church at the back door   don't wait or say a single vow   your time is running out   and they said  "speak now"    i hear the preacher say   "speak now or forever hold your peace "  there's a silence  there's my last chance   i stand up with shaking hands   all eyes on me   horrified looks from everyone in the room   but i'm only lookin' at you    i am not the kind of girl   who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion   but you are not the kind of boy   who should be marryin' the wrong girl    don't say yes  run away now   i'll meet you when you're out   of the church at the back door   don't wait or say a single vow   you need to hear me out   and they said  "speak now"    and you say  "let's run away now   i'll meet you when i'm out of my tux at the back door   oh baby  i didn't say my vow   so glad you were around when they said  "speak now" i said oh my  what a marvelous tune  it was the best night  never would forget how we moved  the whole place  was dressed to the nines  and we were dancing  dancing

 chasing fortune and fame  and the camera flashes  make it look like a dream  you had it figured out since you were in school  everybody loves pretty  everybody loves cool  so over night  you look like a sixties queen  another name goes up in lights  like diamonds in the sky    and they'll tell you now  you're the lucky one  yeah  they'll tell you now  you're the lucky one  but can you tell me now  you're the lucky one?  oh  oh  oh    now it's big black cars and riviera views  and your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you  and your secrets end up  splashed on the news front page  and they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused  'cause you don't feel pretty  you just feel used  and all the young things line up to take your place  another name goes up in lights  you wonder if you'll make it out alive    and they'll tell you now  you're the lucky one  yeah  they'll tell you now  you're the lucky one  can you tell me now  you're the lucky one?  oh  oh  oh    it was a few years later  i showed up here  and they still tell the legend of how you disappeared  they took the money and your dignity and got the hell out    they say you bought a bunch of land somewhere  chose the rose garden over madison square  and it took some time but i understand it now  'cause now my name is up in lights  but i think you got it right    let me tell you now  you're the lucky one  let me tell you now  you're the lucky one  let me tell you now  you're the lucky one  oh  oh  oh    yeah  they'll tell you now  you're the lucky one  yeah  they'll tell you now  you're the lucky one

million little shining stars had just aligned   and i would've been so happy.    christmas lights glisten   i've got my eye on the door   just waiting for you to walk in   but the time is ticking   people ask me how i've been  as i comb back through my memory   how you said you'd be here   you said you'd be here.    and it was like slow motion   standing there in my party dress   in red lipstick   with no one to impress   and they're all laughing   as i'm looking around the room   but there was one thing missing   and that was the moment i knew.    and the hours pass by   now i just wanna be alone   but your close friends always seem to know  when there's something really wrong   so they follow me down the hall   and there in the bathroom   i try not to fall apart   and the sinking feeling starts   as i say hopelessly   "he said he'd be here."    and it was like slow motion   standing there in my party dress   in red lipstick   with no one to impress   and they're all laughing   and asking me about you   but there was one thing missing   and that was the moment i knew.    what do you say  when tears are streaming down your face  in front of everyone you know?  and what do you do when the one  who means the most to you  is the one who didn't show?    you should've been here.  and i would've been so happy.    and it was like slow motion   standing there in my party dress   in red lipstick   with no one to impress   and they're all standing around me singing  "happy birthday to you"   but there was one thing missing   and that was the moment i knew.    ooh  i knew.  ooh     you called me later   and said  "i'm sorry  i didn't make it "  and i said  "i'm sorry too "  and that was the moment i knew. today was a fairytale  you were the prince  i used to be a damsel in distress  you took me by the hand and you picked me up at six  today was a fairytale    today was a fairytale    today was a fairytale  i wore a dress  you wore a dark gray t-shirt  you told me i was

forever  but this is gonna take me down    he's so tall and handsome as hell  he's so bad but he does it so well  i can see the end as it begins  my one condition is    say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress   staring at the sunset  babe  red lips and rosy cheeks  say you'll see me again  even if it's just in your wildest dreams  oh  wildest dreams  oh  ah.    i said  "no one has to know what we do "  his hands are in my hair  his clothes are in my room  and his voice is a familiar sound   nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now    he's so tall and handsome as hell  he's so bad but he does it so well  and when we've had our very last kiss  my last request is    say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress   staring at the sunset  babe  red lips and rosy cheeks  say you'll see me again  even if it's just in your wildest dreams  oh  wildest dreams  oh  ah.    you see me in hindsight  tangled up with you all night  burning it down  someday when you leave me  i bet

it's just in your wildest dreams  oh  ah  in your wildest dreams  ah ah.from the bible to the popular song  there's one theme that we find right along  of all ideals they hail as good  the most sublime is motherhood  there was a man though  who it seems  once carried this ideal to extremes  he loved his mother and she loved him  and yet his story is rather grim    there once lived a man named oedipus rex  you may have heard about his odd complex  his name appears in freud's index 'cause he  loved his mother!  his rivals used to say quite a bit that  as a monarch he was most unfit   but still and all they had to admit that he  loved his mother!    yes he loved his mother like no other  his daughter was his sister  and his son was his brother  one thing on which you can depend is  he sure knew who a boy's best friend is  when he found what he had done  he tore his eyes out one by one  a tragic end to a loyal son who  loved his mother    so be sweet and kind to mother   now and then have a chat  buy her candy or some flowers   or a brand new hat  but  maybe you had better let it go at that  or you may find yourself with a quite complex complex  and  you may end up like oedipus   i'd rather marry a duck-billed platypus   then end up like old oedipus rex! now  i'm sure you're all aware that this week is national gall-bladder week.so as sort of an educational feature at this point i thought i would acquaintyou with some of the results of my rece  searches into the career of the late doctor samuel gall  inventor of the gall-bladder. which certainly ranks as one of the more important technologicaladvances since the invention of the joy-bu  and the dribble-glass. doctor gall's faith in his invention was sodramatically vindicated last year  as you no doubt recall  when  for the firsttime in history  in a nation-wide poll the gall-  er was voted among the top ten organs. his educational career beganinterestingly enough in agricultural school  where he majored in animalhusbandry  until they caught him at it one day.  whereupon he switched to the field of medicine in which field he also wonrenown as the inventor of gargling. which prior to that time had beenpracticed only furtively by a remote tribe in the  who passed the secret down from father to son as part of their oral tradition.he soon became a specialist  specializing in diseases of the rich. he wastherefore able to retire at an early age  the land we all dream about  sunny mexico of course. the last part of which iscompletely irrelevant  as with the whole thing i guess  except  it's a rathersneaky way of getting into this next  of popular song which is one of those things about that magic  and romanticland south of the border.  when it's fiesta time in guadalajara   then i long to be back once again  in old mexico.  where we lived for today   never giving a thought to tomara.  to the strumming of guitars   in a hundred grubby bars  i would whisper "te amo."  the mariachis would serenade   and they would not shut up till they were paid.  we ate  we drank  and we were merry   and we got typhoid and dysentery.  but best of all  we went to the plaza de toros.  now whenever i start feeling morose   i revive by recalling that scene.  and names like belmonte  dominguin  and manolete   if i live to a hundred and eighty   i shall never forget what they mean.   for there is surely nothing more beautiful in this  world than the sight of a lone man facing singlehandedly  a half a ton of angry pot roast!   out came the matador   who must have been potted or  slightly insane  but who looked rather bored.  then the picadors of course   each one on his horse   i shouted "ole!" ev'ry time one was gored.  i cheered at the bandilleros' display   as they stuck the bull in their own clever way   for i hadn't had so much fun since the day  my brother's dog rover  got run over.   rover was killed by a pontiac. and it was done with  such grace and artistry that the witnesses awarded the  driver both ears and the tail - but i digress.   the moment had come   i swallowed my gum   we knew there'd be blood on the sand pretty soon.  the crowd held it's breath   hoping that death  would brighten an otherwise dull afternoon.  at last  the matador did what we wanted him to.  he raised his sword and his aim was true.  in that moment of truth i suddenly knew  that someone had stolen my wallet.  now it's fiesta time in akron  ohio   but it's back to old guadalajara i'm longing to go.  far away from the strikes of the a.f. of l. and c.i.o.  how i wish i could get back  to the land of the wetback   and forget the alamo   in old mexico. ole!   spring is here  spring is here  life is skittles and life is beer  i think the loveliest time of the year  is the spring  i do  don't you? course you do  but there's one thing that makes spring complete for me  and makes every sunday a treat for me    all the world seems in tune on a spring afternoon  when we're poisoning pigeons in the park  every sunday you'll see my sweetheart and me  as we poison the pigeons in the park    when they see us coming  the birdies all try and hide  but they still go for peanuts  when coated with cyanide    the sun's shining bright  everything seems all right  when we're poisoning pigeons in the park    we've gained notoriety  and caused much anxiety  in the audobon society  with our games  they call it impiety  and lack of propriety  and quite a variety of unpleasant names    but it's not against any religion  to want to dispose of a pigeon    so if sunday you're free  why don't you come with me  and we'll poison the pigeons in the park  and maybe we'll do in a squirrel or two  while we're poisoning pigeons in the park    we'll murder them amid laughter and merriment  except for the few we take home to experiment    my pulse will be quickenin'  with each drop of strychnine  we feed to a pigeon  it just takes a smidgin  to poison a pigeon in the parknow i'd like to turn to the folk song  which has become in recent years theparticularly fashionable form of idiocy among the self-styled intellectual. wefind that people who deplore the level  rrent popular songs -- although i admit they do seem to be recording almostanything these days. have you heard sesue hayakawa's record of remember pearlharbor? these same people who deplore th  el of current popular songs and yet will sit around enthralled singing jimmycrack corn and i don't care or green grow the rushes  oh! -- whatever thatmeans. at any rate  for this elite i have  an ancient irish ballad  which was written a few years ago  and which isreplete with all the accoutrements of this art form. in particular  it has asort of idiotic refrain  in this case ricket  kety-tin you'll notice cropping up from time to time  running through  i mightadd  interminable verses. the large number of verses being a feature expresslydesigned to please the true devotees  he folk song who seem to find  singing fifty verses of on top of old smokey is twice as enjoyable as singingtwenty-five.    this type of song also has what is known technically in music as a modal tune which means -- for the benefit of any layman who may have wandered in thisevening -- that i play a wrong note ever  and then.  [piano]  this song though does differ strikingly from the genuine folk ballad in thatin this song the words which are supposed to rhyme - actually do.  [piano]  i  ah  i really should say that - i do not direct these remarks against thevast army of folk song lovers  but merely against that peculiar hard core whoseem to equate authenticity with artisti  it and illiteracy with charm.  [piano]  oh  one more thing. one of the more important aspects of public folk singingis audience participation  and this happens to be a good song for groupsinging. so if any of you feel like joining i  h me on this song  i'd appreciate it if you would leave -- right now.    about a maid i'll sing a song   sing rickety-tickety-tin   about a maid i'll sing a song  who didn't have her family long.  not only did she do them wrong   she did ev'ryone of them in  them in   she did ev'ryone of them in.    one morning in a fit of pique   sing rickety-tickety-tin   one morning in a fit of pique   she drowned her father in the creek.  the water tasted bad for a week   and we had to make do with gin  with gin   we had to make do with gin.    her mother she could never stand   sing rickety-tickety-tin   her mother she cold never stand   and so a cyanide soup she planned.  the mother died with a spoon in her hand   and her face in a hideous grin  a grin   her face in a hideous grin.    she set her sister's hair on fire   sing rickety-tickety-tin   she set her sister's hair on fire   and as the smoke and flame rose high'are   danced around the funeral pyre   playin' a violin  -olin   playin' a violin.    she weighted her brother down with stones   rickety-tickety-tin   she weighted her brother down with stones   and sent him off to davy jones.  all they ever found were some bones   and occasional pieces of skin  of skin   occasional pieces of skin.    one day when she had nothing to do   sing rickety-tickety-tin   one day when she had nothing to do   she cut her baby brother in two   and served him up as an irish stew   and invited the neighbors in  -bors in   invited the neighbors in.    and when at last the police came by   sing rickety-tickety-tin   and when at last the police came by   her little pranks she did not deny   to do so she would have had to lie   and lying  she knew  was a sin  a sin   lying  she knew  was a sin.    my tragic tale  i won't prolong   rickety-tickety-tin   my tragic tale i won't prolong   and if you do not enjoy the song   you've yourselves to blame if it's too long   you should never have let me begin  begin   you should never have let me begin. i wonder how many people here tonight remember hubert humphrey  he used to bea senator. from time to time you read something about him pinning a medal onsomebody or making a speech  or every now and then you read something in oneof those where are they now columns: whatever became of deanna durbin andhubert humphrey and so on.    this became quite an issue last winter at the time of winston churchill'sfuneral  when president johnson was too ill to go and somebody suggested thathe send hubert and he said  "hubert who?" ...and all america was singing:    whatever became of hubert?  has anyone heard a thing?  once he shone on his own   now he sits home alone  and waits for the phone to ring.    once a fiery liberal spirit   ah  but now when he speaks  he must clear it.  second fiddle's a hard part  i know   when they don't even give you a bow.    "we must protest this treatment  hubert"   says each newspaper reader.  as someone once remarked to schubert   "take us to your lieder"...   sorry about that.     whatever became of you  hubert?  we miss you  so tell us  please:  are you sad? are you cross?  are you gathering moss  while you wait for the boss to sneeze?    does lyndon  recalling when he was vp   say "i'll do unto you like they did unto me"?  do you dream about staging a coup?  hubert what happened to you? now we come to that peculiar bit of americana known as the football fightsong. i was reminded not too long ago  upon returning from my lesson with thescrabble pro at the harvard club in boston  of the days of my undergraduacylong ago when there used to be these very long saturday afternoons in the fallwith nothing to do - the library was closed - just waiting around for thecocktail parties to begin. and on occasions like that  some of us used towander over to the...i believe it was called the stadium  to see if anythingmight be going on over there. and one did come to realize that the footballfight songs that one hears in comparable stadia have a tendency to be somewhatuncouth  and even violent  and that it would be refreshing  to say the least to find one that was a bit more genteel. and here it is  dedicated to my ownalma mater  and called fight fiercely  harvard.    fight fiercely  harvard  fight  fight  fight!  demonstrate to them our skill.  albeit they possess the might   nonetheless we have the will.    how we will celebrate our victory   we shall invite the whole team up for tea.  how jolly!   hurl that spheroid down the field   and fight  fight  fight!    fight fiercely  harvard  fight  fight  fight!  impress them with our prowess  do!  oh  fellas  do not let the crimson down   be of stout heart and true.    come on  chaps  fight for harvard's glorious name!  won't it be peachy if we win the game?  oh  goody!   let's try not to injure them   but fight  fight  fight!  let's not be rough  though!  fight  fight  fight!  and do fight fiercely!  fight  fight  fight! well  what i like to do on formal occasions like this is to take some of thevarious types of songs that we all know and presumably love  and  as it were to kick them when they're down. i find that if you take the various popularsong forms to their logical extremes  you can arrive at almost anything fromthe ridiculous to the obscene  or - as they say in new york - "sophisticated".i'd like to illustrate with several hundred examples for you this evening first of all  the southern type song about the wonders of the american south.but it's always seemed to me that most of these songs really don't go farenough. the following song  on the other hand  goes too far. it's called iwant to go back to dixie.    i want to go back to dixie   take me back to dear ol' dixie   that's the only li'l ol' place for li'l ol' me.  old times there are not forgotten   whuppin' slaves and sellin' cotton   and waitin' for the robert e. lee.   it was never there on time.     i'll go back to the swanee   where pellagra makes you scrawny   and the honeysuckle clutters up the vine.1  i really am a-fixin'  to go home and start a-mixin'  down below that mason-dixon line.    oh  poll tax2   how i love ya  how i love ya   my dear ol' poll tax.    won'tcha come with me to alabammy   back to the arms of my dear ol' mammy   her cookin's lousy and her hands are clammy   but what the hell  it's home.    yes  for paradise the southland is my nominee.  jes' give me a ham hock and a grit of hominy.    i want to go back to dixie   i want to be a dixie pixie  and eat corn pone3 till it's comin' outta my ears.4  i want to talk with southern gentlemen  and put that white sheet on again 5  i ain't seen one good lynchin' in years.    the land of the boll weevil   where the laws are medieval   is callin' me to come and nevermore roam.  i want to go back to the southland   that "y'all" and "shet-ma-mouth" land   be it ever so decadent   there's no place like home. next we have the dear-hearts-and-gentle-people's school of songwriting  inwhich the singer tells you that  no matter how much sin and vice and crime goon where he comes from  it's still the be  ace in the world because it's home  you know. sort of gets you. this exampleis called my home town.  i really have a yen  to go back once again   back to the place where no one wears a frown   to see once more those super-special just plain folks  in my home town.  no fellow could ignore  the little girl next door   she sure looked sweet in her first evening gown.  now there's a charge for what she used to give for free  in my home town.  i remember dan  the druggist on the corner  'e  was never mean or ornery   he was swell.  he killed his mother-in-law and ground her up real well   and sprinkled just a bit  over each banana split.  the guy that taught us math   who never took a bath   acquired a certain measure of renown   and after school he sold the most amazing pictures  in my home town.  that fellow was no fool  who taught our sunday school   and neither was our kindly parson brown.  we're recording tonight so i have to leave this line out.  in my home town.  i remember sam  he was the village idiot.  and though it seems a pity  it  was so.  he loved to burn down houses just to watch the glow   and nothing could be done   because he was the mayor's son.  the guy that took a knife  and monogrammed his wife   then dropped her in the pond and watched her drown.  oh  yes indeed  the people there are just plain folks  in my home town.   one week of every year is designated national brotherhood week. this is justone of many such weeks honoring various worthy causes. one of my favorites isnational make-fun-of-the-handicapped week which frank fontaine and jerry lewisare in charge of as you know. during national brotherhood week various specialevents are arranged to drive home the message of brotherhood. this year  forexample  on the first day of the week malcolm x was killed which gives you anidea of how effective the whole thing is. i'm sure we all agree that we oughtto love one another and i know there are people in the world that do not lovetheir fellow human beings and i hate people like that. here's a song aboutnational brotherhood week.    oh  the white folks hate the black folks   and the black folks hate the white folks.  to hate all but the right folks  is an old established rule.    but during national brotherhood week  national brotherhood week   lena horne and sheriff clarke are dancing cheek to cheek.  it's fun to eulogize  the people you despise   as long as you don't let 'em in your school.    oh  the poor folks hate the rich folks   and the rich folks hate the poor folks.  all of my folks hate all of your folks   it's american as apple pie.    but during national brotherhood week  national brotherhood week   new yorkers love the puerto ricans 'cause it's very chic.  step up and shake the hand  of someone you can't stand.  you can tolerate him if you try.    oh  the protestants hate the catholics   and the catholics hate the protestants   and the hindus hate the moslems   and everybody hates the jews.    but during national brotherhood week  national brotherhood week   it's national everyone-smile-at-one-another-hood week.  be nice to people who  are inferior to you.  it's only for a week  so have no fear.  be grateful that it doesn't last all year! i do have a cause  though  it is obscenity. i'm for it!  laughter  thank you.  unfortunately  the civil liberties types who are fighting this issue have tofight it   owing to the nature of the laws   as a matter of freedom of speech and stifling of free expression and so on.    but we know what's really involved: dirty books are fun!  that's all there is to it.  but you can't get up in a court and say that   i suppose.    it's simply a matter of freedom of pleasure   a right which is not guaranteed by the constitution  unfortunately.  anyway  since people seem to be marching for their causes these days   i have here a march for mine. it's called:    smut!  give me smut and nothing but!  a dirty novel i can't shut  if it's uncut  and unsubt-le.    i've never quibbled  if it was ribald.  i would devour  where others merely nibbled.    as the judge remarked the day that he acquitted my aunt hortense   "to be smut  it must be ut-  terly without redeeming social importance."    por-  nographic pictures i adore.  indecent magazines galore   i like them more  if they're hardcore.    bring on the obscene movies  murals  postcards  neckties  samplers  stained  glass windows  tattoos  anything!  more  more  i'm still not satisfied!    stories of tortures  used by debauchers  lurid  licentious and vile   make me smile.    novels that pander  to my taste for candor  give me a pleasure sublime.  let's face it i love slime!    old books can be indecent books   though recent books are bolder.  for filth  i'm glad to say   is in the mind of the beholder.    when correctly viewed   everything is lewd.  i could tell you things about peter pan  and the wizard of oz - there's a dirty old man!    i thrill  to any book like fanny hill   and i suppose i always will  if it is swill  and really fil-thy.    who needs a hobby like tennis or philately?  i've got a hobby: rereading lady chatterley.  but now they're trying to take it all away from us unless  we take a stand  and hand in hand we fight for freedom of the press.    in other words: smut! i love it.  ah  the adventures of a slut.  oh  i'm a market they can't glut.  i don't know what  compares with smut.  hip  hip  hooray!  let's hear it for the supreme court!  don't let them take it away!now is the climax to the story  that gives the demons and angels purpose  they fly around while we are walking  and mold our emotions just to please them  i am cold  can you hear  i will fly  with no hope  no fear  and the ground  taunts my wings  plummet as i sing  plummet as i sing  all we are is an isle of flightless birds  we find our worth in giving birth and stuff  we're lining our homes against winding roads  and we think the going is tough  we pick songs to sing  remind us of things that no body cares about  and honestly we're probably more suicidal than ever now  if you decide to live by  what you think's wrong and what's right  believe me you'll begin to wish you were sleeping  your weeping will creep in head and you'll cry  but if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe  we can take a part our very heart and the light will set you free  i am cold  can you hear  i will fly  with no hope  no fear  and the ground  taunts my wings  plummet as i sing  plummet as i sing  how frustrating  and so degrading  his time  we're wasting  and time will fly by and the sky will cry as light is fading  and he is waiting  oh so patiently  while we repeat the same routine as we will please comfortability  please think about why you can't sleep in the evening  and please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking  your soul knows good and evil  your soul knows both sides  and it's time you pick your battle  and i promise you this is mine he stays home from work this time  he never really told his wife  he never really told a lie but this time he decides that it's alright.  it's alright.  no one really knows his mind and no one knows behind his eyes.  the man deserves a medal  but he's never really won a prize before.  he goes to lock the door.    he is falling  and though he knows it's not  the world looks down and frowns.    get up johnny boy  get up johnny boy   get up cause the world has left you lying on the ground.  you're my pride and joy  you're my pride and joy.  get up johnny boy because we all need you now.    we all need you now.    someone said where you going  someone said to you goodbye  they deflect the disrespect when they say that they blame it on the times  they blame it on the time.  we all know you're qualified to fix a chair and love your wife  they all know you're qualified but they lie when they blame it on the times.  and we blame it on the times.    oh he is falling  and though he knows it's not  the world looks down and frowns.    get up johnny boy  get up johnny boy  get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.  you're my pride and joy  you're my pride and joy.  get up johnny boy because we all need you now.    we all need you now    i will carry all your names and i will carry all your shame  and i will carry all your names and i will carry all your shame  and i will carry all your names and i will carry all your shame    get up johnny boy  get up johnny boy  get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.  you're my pride and joy  you're my pride and joy.  get up johnny boy because we all need you now.  get up johnny boy  get up johnny boy  get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.  you're my pride and joy  you're my pride and joy.  get up johnny boy because we all need you now. hello  we haven't talked in quite some time  i know  i haven't been the best  of sons  hello  i've been traveling in  the desert of my mind  and i  haven't found a drop  of life  i haven't found a drop  of you  i haven't found a drop  of water    i try desperately to run through the sand  as i hold the water  in the palm of my hand  cuz it's all that i have  it's all that i need and  the waves of the water  mean nothing to me  but i try my best  and all that i can to  hold tightly onto  what's left in my hand  but no matter how  how tightly i will strain  the sand will slow me down  and the water will drain  i'm just being dramatic  in fact   i'm only at it again  as an addict with a pen  who's addicted to the wind  as it blows me back and fourth  mindless  spineless  and pretend  of course i'll be here again  see you tomorrow  but it's the end of today  end of my ways  as a walking denial  my trial was filed as a crazy  suicidal head case  but you specialize in dying  you hear me screaming  father  and i'm lying here just crying  so wash me with your water    hello  we haven't talked in quite some time  i know  i haven't been the best there's miles of land in front of us   and we're dying with every step we take   we're dying with every breath we make   and all fall in line.    a stranger's back is all i see   he's only a few feet in front of me   and all look left and right sometimes   but all fall in line.    no one looks up anymore   'cause you might get a raindrop in your eye   and heaven forbid  they see you cry   as we fall in line.    and about this time of every year   the line will go to the ocean pier   and walk right off into the sea   then we fall asleep.    as we near the end of land   and our ocean graves are just beyond the sand   i ask myself the question  why  i fall in line.    then out of the corner of my eye   i see a spaceship in the sky   and hear a voice inside my head:  "follow me instead."[2x]    follow me.    then the wages of war will start   inside my head with my counterpart   and the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase:  "this line 's the only way."    then i start down the sand   my eyes are focused on the end of land   but again the voice inside my head  says  "follow me instead."    follow me instead.    follow me.    follow me instead.[4x]    take me up. seal the door.  i don't want to march here anymore.  i realize that this line is dead   so i'll follow you instead.    so then you put me back in my place   so i might start another day   and once again  i will be  in a march to the sea.i ponder of something great  my lungs will fill and then deflate  they fill with fire  exhale desire  i know it's dire my time today    i have these thoughts  so often i ought  to replace that slot with what i once bought  'cause somebody stole my car radio  and now i just sit in silence    sometimes quiet is violent  i find it hard to hide it  my pride is no longer inside  it's on my sleeve  my skin will scream reminding me of  who i killed inside my dream  i hate this car that i'm driving  there's no hiding for me  i'm forced to deal with what i feel  there is no distraction to mask what is real  i could pull the steering wheel    i have these thoughts  so often i ought  to replace that slot with what i once bought  'cause somebody stole my car radio  and now i just sit in silence    i ponder of something terrifying  'cause this time there's no sound to hide behind  i find over the course of our human existence  one thing consists of consistence  and it's that we're all battling fear  oh dear  i don't know if we know why we're here  oh my  too deep  please stop thinking  i liked it better when my car had sound    there are things we can do  but from the things that work there are only two  and from the two that we choose to do  peace will win and fear will lose  it is faith and there's sleep  we need to pick one please because  faith is to be awake  and to be awake is for us to think  and for us to think is to be alive  and i will try with every rhyme  to come across like i am dying  to let you know you need to try to think    i have these thoughts  so often i ought  to replace that slot with what i once bought  'cause somebody stole my car radio  and now i just sit in silence    and now i just sit in silence  and now i just sit  and now i just sit in silence  and now i just sit in silence  and now i just sit in silence  and now i just sit    i ponder of something great  my lungs will fill and then deflate  they fill with fire  exhale desire  i know it's dire my time today    i have these thoughts  so often i ought  to replace that slot with what i once bought  'cause somebody stole my car radio  and now i just sit in silence [intro]  all my friends are heathens  take it slow   wait for them to ask you who you know.  please don't make any

 you think twice about your life  it probably happens at night  right?    fight it  take the pain  ignite it  tie a noose around your mind  loose enough to breath fine and tie it  to a tree tell it   you belong to me  this ain't a noose  this is a leash and i have news for you  you must obey me!    you are surrounding all my surroundings  sounding down the mountain range  of my left-side brain  you are surrounding all my surroundings  twisting the kaleidoscope  behind both of my eyes    entertain my faith    lean with it  rock with it  when we gonna stop with it?  lyrics that mean nothing  we were gifted with thought    is it time to move our feet  to an introspective beat  it ain't the speakers that bump hard  it's our hearts that make the beat    and i'll be holding on to you i do not know why i would go  in front of you and hide my soul  'cause you're the only one who knows it   yeah you're the only one who knows it    and i will hide behind my pride  don't know why i think i can lie  'cause there's a screen on my chest  yeah there's a screen on my chest    [chorus: x2]  i'm standing in front of you  i'm standing in front of you  i'm trying to be so cool  everything together trying to be so cool    i can't see past my own nose  i'm seeing everything in slo-mo  look out below crashing down to the ground just like a vertical locomotive  that's a train  am i painting the picture that's in my brain?  a train from the sky  locomotive  my motives are insane  my flow's not great  okay  i conversate with people  who know if i flow on a song i'll get no radio play  while you're doing fine  there's some people and i  who have a really tough time getting through this life  so excuse us while we sing to the sky.

judge  oh no  set me free  you're the judge  oh no  set me freeyou think you own whatever land you land on  the earth is just a dead thing you can claim  but i know every rock and tree and creature  has a life  has a spirit  has a name    you think the only people who are people  are the people who look and think like you  but if you walk the footsteps of a stranger  you'll learn things you never knew you never knew    have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon  or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?  can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?  can you paint with all the colors of the wind?  can you paint with all the colors of the wind?    come run the hidden pine trails of the forest  come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth  come roll in all the riches all around you  and for once  never wonder what they're worth  the rainstorm and the river are my brothers  the heron and the otter are my friends  and we are all connected to each other   in a circle  in a hoop that never ends    have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon  or let the eagle tell you where he's been  can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?  can you paint with all the colors of the wind  can you paint with all the colors of the wind    how high does the sycamore grow?  if you cut it down  then you'll never know    and you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon  for whether we are white or copper-skinned  we need to sing with all the voices of the mountain  need to paint with all the colors of the wind  you can own the earth and still  all you'll own is earth until  you can paint with all the colors of the wind way back  take a look  she would cook  when they were stompin' at the savoy  she would blow  and they would dance  don't you know ?

sometimes the snow comes down in june  sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon  i see the passion in your eyes  sometimes it's all a big surprise    'cause there was a time when all i did was wish  you'd tell me this was love  it's not the way i hoped or how i planned  but some how it's enough    and now we're standing face to face  isn't this world a crazy place  just when i thought our chance had passed  you go and save the best for last    all of the nights you came to me  when some silly girl had set you free  you wondered how you'd make it through  i wondered what was wrong with you    'cause how could you give your love to someone else  and share your dreams with me  sometimes the very thing you're looking for  is the one thing you can't see    and now we're standing face to face  isn't this world a crazy place  just when i thought our chance had passed  you go and save the best for last    sometimes the very thing you're looking for  is the one thing you can't see    sometimes the snow comes down in june  sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon  just when i thought our chance had passed  you go and save the best for last    you went and saved the best for last all alone  a rainy night  no one around but i fell someone watching me  i look around  the street is bare nobody there  i wonder what it could be  as i turned to walk away  suddenly i saw his face  never minding that we were alone  didn't care about the time  at the moment i was felling fine    i was looking into stranger's eyes   he caught me by surprise   they looked right through me   he looking into my

in the strangest places  places you never knew it could be    some find it in the face of their children  some find it in their lover's eyes  who can deny the joy it brings  when you found that special thing  you're flying without wings    some find it sharing every morning  some in their solitary lives  you find it in the words of others  a simple line can make you laugh or cry    you find it in the deepest friendship  the kind you cherish all your life  and when you know how much that means  you've found that special thing  you're flying without wings    so impossible as they may seem  you've got to fight for every dream  'cause who's to know  which one you let go  would have made you complete    well  for me it's waking up beside you  to watch the sunrise on your face  to know that i can say i love you  in any given time or place  it's little things that only i know  those are the things that make you mine    and it's like flying without wings  'cause you're my special thing  i'm flying without wings    and you're the place my life begins  and you'll be where it ends  i'm flying without wings  and that's the joy you bring  i'm flying without wings saying i love you  is not the words  i want to hear from you  it's not that i want you  not to say  but if you only knew  how easy  it would be to  show me how you feel  more than words  is all you have to do  to make it real  then you wouldn't  have to say  that you love me  cos i'd already know    what would you do  if my heart was torn in two  more than words to show you feel  that your love for me is real  what would you say  if i took those words away  then you couldn't make things new  just by saying i love you    its more than words   its more than what you say  its the things you do  oh yeah  its more than words   its more than what you say  its the things you do  oh yeah    now that i've tried to  talk to you  and make you understand  all you have to do  is close your eyes  and just reach out your hands    and touch me  hold me close  don't ever let me go  more than words  is all i ever  needed you to show  then you wouldn't have to say  that you love me  cos i'd already know    what would you do  if my heart was torn in two  more than words to show you feel  that your love for me is real  what would you say if i took those words away  then you couldn't make things new  just by saying i

night  the night goes into    morning  just another day  happy people pass my way  looking in their eyes  i see a memory  i never realized  how happy you made me  oh mandy    well you came and you gave without taking  and i sent you away  oh mandy  and you kissed me and stopped me from shaking  and i need you today  oh mandy    i'm standing on the edge of time  walked away when love was mine  caught up in a world of uphill climbing  the tears are in my eyes  and nothing is rhyming  oh mandy    well you came and you gave without taking  and i sent you away  oh mandy  and you kissed me and stopped me from shaking  and i need you today  oh mandy    yesterday's a dream  now i face the morning  crying on the breeze  the pain is calling  oh mandy    well you came and you gave without taking  and i sent you away  oh mandy  and you kissed me and stopped me from shaking  and i need you today  oh mandy    well you came and you gave without taking  and i sent you away  oh mandy  and you kissed me and stopped me from shaking  and i need you today  oh mandy my love  my heart  oh bruised and broken  all alone when we're apart  i die inside   oh this room is like a battlefield of love tonight  i know i should be stronger but i lose all control  fighting with myself tryna hide what you don't know    but i get weak  i'm giving it all away  i know it's not wise to leave myself so opened but  all the rules get broken in your eyes  i give it all up to you  and everything that's been keeping me together  brings me to my knees  i get weak    one look  one touch  oh i'm helplessly pretending you don't mean that much  it gets so hard  the waiting here forever with this shattered heart  lying to myself tryna act like i don't care  no  the way it's killing me every time that you're not there    cause i get weak  i'm giving it all away  i know it's not wise to leave myself so opened but  all the rules get broken in your eyes  i give it all up to you  and everything that's been keeping me together  brings me to my knees  i get weak    i get weak  and all the walls i've been building up  just crack and then break when you're around  i get weak  and nothing i do to fight it matters now    i get weak  i'm giving it all away  i know it's not wise to leave myself so opened but  all the rules get broken in your eyes  i give it all up to you  and everything that's been keeping me together  brings me to my knees    i get weak  oh   i get weak  oh   i get weak  oh     all the rules get broken in your eyes  i give it all up to you  and everything that's been keeping me together  brings me to my knees here i stand.  looking in your eyes  i'm an open book.  shatter heart is all i have to give   and that's what you took.  feels so good  that i can't say goodbye.  watching time  fly by.  will it stop if i close my eyes?    if i could  make a moment last forever.  this would be the one i choose.  you and me here together.  feels so right  feels so true.  every star  let to you  shine so bright.  no one's gonna sleep tonight.  no  no one's gonna sleep tonight.    from the start   i knew that we'd be here dancing in the dark.  feel the spark   you can sign your name right across my heart.  it's so good   i just want you to stay.  tell me why  we feel   it's never gonna go away.    if i could  make a moment last forever.  this would be the one i choose.  you and me here together.  feels so right  feels so true.  every star  let to you  shine so bright.  no one's gonna sleep tonight.  no  no one's gonna sleep tonight.    all my life i've waited.  afraid to surrender.  always gone whatever.  now i'm wondering    if i could  make a moment last forever.  this would be the one i choose.  you and me here together.  feels so right  feels so true.

to console  an ear to confide  that someone you tell  your deepest of feelings inside      but we didn't know  when we held each other  it would feel so right  we didn't know  on that night we'd be falling in love  i looked at you  you looked at me  in ways we never thought we would be  but like tomorrow's today's mystery  we didn't know    be it big  be it small  on you i could call  nothing but to ask  you'd be right there in a flash    a hand i could hold  that friend i could trust  but the love that we shared  was just platonic between us        that's what happens  when innocent friends  turn serious lovers  and we're so happy that  we've fallen in love  and still can be best of friends    when they'd break your heart  and when they'd make you cry  we both would confer  you should give love one more try    we've searched everywhere  for true love to find  yet who'd think it was us  that we were longing for all the time    'cause we didn't know  when we held each other  it would feel so right  we didn't know  on that night we'd be falling in love  i looked at you  and you looked at me  in ways we never thought  we would be  but just like the future  no one can see  we didn't know     if there's a time  when the tears should fill your eyes  and you can't see past the shadows  to the sun on the other side  don't despair  because there always will be someone there  don't lose faith  love won't let you lose your way  because you      you'll never stand alone  i'll be standing by  i'll keep you from the cold  i'll hold you when you cry  i'll be there to be strong  when you can't find the strength inside  and you  you'll always have a home  in these arms of mine  and you'll never stand alone  love is standing by    oh yes it is  yes  if there's a day when the rain should find your heart  and you're cold and tired and lonely  and this world has you in the dark  don't be scared  you can just reach for me  and i'll be there  don't lose hope  love will see you through you know  i'll be  'cause you        standing by to life you above  all the hurt and pain  oh yeah  standing by to carry you through  all the tears and rain  oh reach for me   i'll be there for you   reach for me babe  yeah   i'll see you through   see i'll be the one to hold you  the one to show you that you    [chorus: x2]    oh  love is standing by remember when  it all began  we were

where to go  lost sight of my dream     thought it would be the end of me  i thought i'd never make it through  i had no hope to hold on to   i thought i would break    i didn't know my own strength  and i crashed down  and i tumbled  but i did not crumble  i got through all the pain    i didn't know my own strength  survived my darkest hour  my faith kept me alive  i picked myself back up    hold my head up high  i was not built to break  i didn't know my own strength    found hope in my heart   i found the light to life  my way out the dark  found all that i need  here inside of me    i thought i'd never find my way  i thought i'd never lift that weight  i thought i would break    i didn't know my own strength  and i crashed down  and i tumbled  but i did not crumble  i got through all the pain    i didn't know my own strength  survived my darkest hour  my faith kept me alive  i picked myself back up    hold my head up high  i was not built to break  i didn't know my own strength    there were so many times i  wondered how i'd get through the night i  thought took all i could take    i didn't know my own strength  and i crashed down  and i tumbled  but i did not crumble  i got through all the pain    i didn't know my own strength  survived my darkest hour  my faith kept me alive  i picked myself back up    hold my head up high  i was not built to break  i didn't know my own strength    i was not built to break  i got to know my own strength as i lay me down  heaven hear me now  i'm lost without a cause  after giving it my all    winter storms have come

the basket sways  left to right  sit and talk shit all night  does that make it right for smoke  maybe  or am i just seeing shit?  seeing the pain inside in this house of fear    you don't even wanna know about the things i hear  quick fix  headlines shine bright  you're the fuckin' deal  i'm just wishing it's ambition that got you your position  you'll be fishing for far too long  you're the bad guy in this movie  and i ain't wrong  i don't breathe the pollution  and the only solution is making shit confusing    ain't about who's winning or losing  it's bout the path you're choosing  time heals pain and promotes self-soothing  when the scars are gone  you can't see bruising  wanna take these watches  chains and gold rings  i'm getting caught up in the feelings that they bring  a lack of sanity  losing touch with reality  smoking too much  it's starting to fog up my clarity  traveling in the day but you're still looking far to me    bullseye  you the dot to me  emotions splattered  same pattern  can't even begin to spot 'em  i'm sad about shit that never happened  no lies in my eyes  nothing but truth will leave my mouth  i'm tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out  i'm tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out    she's older  i told her we ain't meant to be  it takes two not three  but i'm here anyway  i hope he's leaving soon  started not to see the
