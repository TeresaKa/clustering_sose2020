was you    did you read the morning paper  did you see the front headline  did you read the morning paper  baby let me lend you mine    now i know why you've been working late each night  and no

you  i'm gonna be stuck with it  no matter what i do    take these arms that held you close  i thought i was the one you needed the most  take these hands  they're no good to me  that used to touch you so tenderly    but i can't give back the love  that's a part of me  if you want just a little bit  you have to take all of me    here's a ring  that didn't mean a thing  and the letters you wrote

you told me you were leaving  you gave your folks the blame  and made me cry again  when you said    little girl  please don't wait for me  wait patiently for love  someday will surely come  ooh  little girl  please don't wait for me  wait patiently for love  someday will surely come  and i'm still waiting    i'm waiting  ooh  still waiting  i'm just a fool  ooh  i'm a fool  to keep waiting    then someone finally came  he told me that he loved me  i put him off with lies  he could see i had no eyes  so he left me once again alone  like a child without her playmate  i had to face the truth  i was still in love with you  but you said:    little girl  please don't wait for me  wait patiently for love  someday will surely come  ooh  little girl  please don't wait for me  wait patiently for

us seen all over town  now there's only two  someone's missing  guess who?    now i see how she schemed  and worked her way in between  planted seeds of mistrust  to make us fight unaware  her comforting ways when i would cry  shadowed the look of triumph in her eye  just like a snake on the limb tree  a friend is an enemy you can see    'cause what you got  that'll make you lose  and then turn around and step in your shoes  i said they'll turn around  and step in your shoes    so you better keep an eye on your close friend  you better watch out for your close friend  don't trust nobody

you hold me  and make me feel so good  though i say i wouldn't  you kinda knew that i would  it's been so long since i've  been with a man  better ask myself  while i still can  is this love or is it just loneliness  when the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  is this love or is it just loneliness  we ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it  and how about you  do you really want me  or am i just here  to please your masculinity  you don't see me emough  to let me know you care  you know the worst thing for a woman  is a sometime love affair  seems like every time  i satisfy your needs  you don't call me back  for two or three weeks  what am i gonna do  i just can't fight  the temptation of loving you  is this love or is it just loneliness  when the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  is this love or is it just loneliness  we ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it  sometimes it's hard  to tel the difference  i'm just not sure  if it's worth it  is this love or is it just loneliness  when the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  is this love or is it just loneliness  we ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it  'cause you never show up 'til midnight  then you go home early  now you know that ain't right  i've got a question i wanna ask you  do you really love me or am i just a fool  is this love or is it just loneliness  when the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  is this love or is it just loneliness  we ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it   i thought i'd already touched the sky  i got to know you and i don't know why  but all of my life couldn't mean as much  as just being touched by you    i never thought of me growing up  got my directions but the road was rough  it's only the dream of a teenage queen  but somehow i made it through    and i'd love to see  those faces of those friends i left behind  and even those who spoke for me  just trying to be kind  and no one said i love you just the way  i know you do    and i love being in love with you  living inside your heart  the giving and the taking  you are not forsaken  i love being in love with you  thank you just for choosing me  that we should be  being in love forever  and ever  ever    i stare and wonder at what i found  i just discovered why the world is round  round in a circle my arms will be  and doing the same as you  it ain't right it's only for you and me  only the lonely do it separately  keep it alive on the food of love  but only the chosen few    in my life you see some changes in me  we listen and we grow  any child that clings to childish things  is trying to let go  and up to now  i'd thought i'd seen as far as i could see    and i love being in love with you  living inside your heart  the giving and the taking  you are not forsaken  i love being in love with you  thank you just for choosing me  that we should be  being in love forever  and ever  ever    and i love being in love with you  living inside your heart  the giving and the taking  you are not forsaken  i love being in love with you  thank you just for choosing me  that we should be you took a mystery and made me want it  you got a pedestal and put me on it  you made me love you out of feeling nothing  something that you do  and i was there and not dancing with anyone  you took a little  then you took me over  you set your mark on stealing my heart away  crying  trying  anything for you    i'm in the middle of a chain reaction  you give me all the after midnight action  i want to get you where i can let you make all that love to me  i'm on a journey for the inspiration  to anywhere and there ain't no salvation  i need you to get me nearer to you  so you can set me free  we

nature has a way of yielding treasure  pleasure made for you  oh  you gotta plan  your future is on the run  shine a light for the whole world over  you never find your love if you hide away  crying  dying  all you gotta do is    get in the middle of a chain reaction  you get a medal when you're lost in action  i want to get your love all ready for the sweet sensation  instant radiation  you let

night while we were talking  the way that old friends do  i suddenly got lost in my yesterdays with you  i told you that in my heart  you would always be the one  that i'd lie waking in the dark  pray that you will come  but i didn't mean to say that  somehow it just slipped out  i swear that i would take it back  if i could right now  all i ask is you believe  i'd forgotten where i was  with you there so close to me  i thought that we were still in love  oh i knew just what i'd done when you stood up so fast  and say the friends that we'd become  can't hold on to the past  you said it's been a long  long time  since love came to an end  if i hadn't learned to draw the line  it's useless to pretend  but i didn't mean to say that  somehow it just slipped out  i swear that i would take it back  if i could right now  all i ask is you believe  i'd forgotten where i was  with you there so close to me  i thought that we were still in love  i don't think i could take goodbye  that much is still the truth  won't you forgive me just for one night  it's what a friend would do  'coz i didn't mean to say that  somehow it just slipped out  i swear that i would take it back  if i could right now  all i ask is you believe  i'd forgotten where i was  with you there so close to me  i thought that we were still in love  still in love  i thought that we were still in love   at first i was afraid  i was petrified  kept thinkin' i could never live without you by my side  then i spent so many nights just thinking how you did me wrong  and i grew strong  and i learned how to get along    and so you're back from outer space  i just walked in to find you here  with that look upon your face  i should have changed that stupid lock  i should have made you leave your key  if i had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me    go on now  go walk out the door  just turn around now  'cause you're not welcome anymore  weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?  did you think i'd crumble?  did you think i'd lay down and die?  oh no not i  i will survive  for as long as i know how to love  i know i'll stay alive  i've got all my life to live  and i've got all my love to give  i'll survive  i will survive  hey hey     i  i will survive   hey hey   i  i will survive   every day   i  i will survive   oh yeah    it took all the strength i had not to fall apart  just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart  and i spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself  i used to cry  but now i hold my head up high  and you see me  somebody new  i'm not that chained up little person still in love with you  and so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free  but now i'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me    go on now  go walk out the door  just turn around now  you're not welcome anymore  weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?  did you think i'd crumble?  did you think i'd lay down and die?  oh no not i  i

for the truth  and now this whole world cries  because it realizes  there is none quite like you  the earth  the stars  the universe  they just repeat these words so true  life begins and life will end with you  hear me singing  when i die  what will they say about me?  will the work that i've done  be enough to help someone?  when i die  will i draw men's hearts to you?  at the setting of the sun  wanna hear you say  well done  when i die  well done  well done  i know he will make me the spirit and the [incomprehensible]   so many different religions  and so many different churches  and if god really loves me  then why does life keep hurting me?  have you ever asked any of these questions?  well my friend i've got the answer just listen    you have the power  to make the seasons change  the river flows for you  the wind whispers your name  for me you left your throne  and traded crown for thorns instead  i'm safe within not by your skin  but because your blood was red    some say you're black  you're white  they question if you're real  we treat you like we treat ourselves  i wonder how you feel  to see your children fight in spite  of the tears for us you've shed  doesn't matter what color you are  as long as your blood was red    for it's strong enough to wash away my sins  and it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within  and it's real enough to find me when i'm lost  great enough to die upon the cross  it doesn't matter what color you are  as long as your blood was red    we may be different but  the god we serve's the same  yet every sunday we separate  and bring the father pain  your name is higher than any other  yet you took my place instead  and now my sins are washed away  because your blood was red    for it's strong enough to wash away my sins  and it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within  and it's real enough to find me when i'm lost  great enough to die upon the cross  it doesn't matter what color you are  as long as your blood was red    oh precious is the flow  that makes me white as snow  no other fount i know  doesn't matter what color you are  as long as your blood was red  doesn't matter what color you are  as you are as long as your blood was red  doesn't matter what color i am  as long as my blood was red i see you  i need you  but i don't know your name  i touch you  say i love you  but that's all you get for today  it's easy  so easy  to tell you it's gon' be okay  when i don't walk shoes  haven't been through what you been through  instead i push you away  sunday everyone looks like you  but if our lives are cold inside tell me what's the use    if i say i love jesus  but you can't see my jesus  my words are empty  if they can't see jesus in me  no more excuses  i give myself away  because i may be the only jesus they see    too busy  forgive me  i've got problems of my own  it's easier to say your help is on the way  but i was your help all along  we're shouting  we're dancing  but can the world see a change  am i just too selfish to see  the love they need you put inside of me    if we say we love jesus  but they can't see our jesus  tell me what's the use if they can't see jesus in you and me  no more excuses  we give it all away  because we may be the only jesus they see    if i am your hands and your feet  and if your church is built inside of me  where did we go wrong  we been here too long

see for myself  but i never really cared  much about love  i thought i could live without it  until i met this one girl  and she was so fine  i knew she was the one who could change my mind    see  i used to be such a bad  bad boy  and good times were my toy for joy  that was all i was thinking of  but i gave it up when i fell in love  i used to know the party people around the world  i gave it up when i found that girl  and she's the one treats me good enough  so i gave it up when i fell in love    i thought i was justified  to only see the world through my eyes  and that it was a waste of time  talkin' 'bout love  but it only took a little time  to make me change my mind  'cause when she said goodbye  see  i really thought i'd never stop crying    now  every night i dream about you and our new love  all of my friends say oh i'm such a different guy  and they wonder  oh  how they wonder    i gave it up  sho 'nuff gave it up  that was all i was thinking of  but i gave it up when i fell in love i told my girl bye-bye  bye   and i really didn't mean it  said i met somebody new so fine  fine   and i really didn't mean it    out of my head to say the things i said  i didn't mean a word  think jealousy just took a hold of me  i hope she'll ignore the things she heard   no doubt about it  my heart is in her hands   with every moment  i'm waiting for a second chance   maybe an angel  will come and help her see  i can't face the world if she don't love me    i told my girl bye-bye  bye   and i really didn't mean it  said i met somebody new so fine  fine   and i really didn't mean it  when i walked away i cried  cried   and i really didn't mean it  so she took me back cause she knew i  i   really didn't mean it    dear one from me take my apology  i need you back  i promise i know o never let you go  is there a chance to see you baby   they talk about all  the love that we still share   from her emotion  i barely miss your happiness   you're missing and mourning  the way it used to be  i know it's true but i don't believe    i told my girl bye-bye  bye   and i really didn't mean it  said i met somebody new so fine  fine   and i really didn't mean it  when i walked away i cried  cried   and i really didn't mean it  so she took me back cause she knew i  i   really didn't mean it    i want you back it can't be any other way  i want you back and i've waited for the day  i want you back i'm gonna be a little smarter  i want you back i'm gonna try a little harder  she's good she's fine and always on my mind  i know our love will stand the test of time  she's my girl and my best friend  and i really didn't mean it  her love is love so fine and so for real  i want the world to know the way i feel  she's my girl and my best friend  and i really didn't mean it  yeah... yeah.. ooh...    i told my girl bye-bye  bye   and i really didn't mean it  said i met somebody new so fine  fine   and i really didn't mean it  when i walked away i cried  cried   and i really didn't mean it  so she took me back cause she knew i  i   really didn't mean it   all of the band was on time for rehearsal  and played everything just right  then came the news telling me not to worry  the show is selling out tonight  well  the lights went on and suddenly the crowd began to scream  and as you could well imagine  it was like living a dream  oh  but when the lights went down and the standing "o" was done  i was just another lonely guy who didn't have no one    i wanted your love  your love  your love  love  love  love  love    so busy daydreaming 'bout you baby  i didn't even hear the phone  then when my friends rang the doorbell it scared me  they said  "we're so glad you're home!  you just won a million dollars and a trip around the world?  better get yourself and forget about that girl  they thought i was acting crazy not to get excited too  but all the money in the world could never take the place of you    all over the city the lights were so pretty  the holiday was filled with cheer  the stars really glistened and lovers were kissin'  it was the special part of the year  so what a perfect time it was to find someone to say "i do"  thought that i could still be happy even though she wasn't you  we had told the world we were going to ring the wedding bell  but when i really thought about it  i was really lying to myself   if this world were mine  i would place at your feet  all that i own  you've been so good to me  if this world were mine    i'd give the flowers the birds and the bees  and it'd be your love beside me  that would be all i need  if this world were mine  i'd give you anything    if this world were mine  i would make you a king  with wealth untold  you could have anything  if this world were mine    i'd give you each day  so sunny and blue  and if you wanted the moonlight  i'd give you that too  if this world were mine  oh baby  i'd give you anything    oh baby  you're my inspiration  and i feel so much sensation  when i'm in your arms  when you squeeze me    oh  the way that you do  oh  the way that you love me my  oh yeah  oh yeah  the way that you do  ooh  the way that you love me    oh  oh  oh

my love fantasy  there's not a minute  hour  day or night that i don't love you  you're at the top of my list 'cause i'm always thinking of ya  i still remember in the days when i was scared to touch you  how i spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say "i love you"  you must have known that i had feelings deep enough to swim in  that's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in    oh my love  a thousand kisses from you  is never too much  i just don't wanna stop  oh my love  a million days in your arms  is never too much  i just don't wanna stop  never too much  never too much  never too much  never too much    woke up today  looked at your picture just to get me started  i called you up but you weren't there and i was broken hearted  hung up the phone  can't be too late  the boss is so demandin'  opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standin'  who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar?  i'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler  love is a gamble and i'm so glad that i am winnin'  we've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning    oh my love  a thousand kisses from you  is never too much  i just don't wanna stop  oh my love  a million days in your arms  is never too much  i just don't wanna stop  oh my love  a thousand kisses from you is never  a thousand kisses from you  a thousand kisses from you is never to much   i had known you for quite sometime   but the thought of love never crossed my mind.  it seemed to be on the other side of the world.    too many times had i loved   and not cared at all about love.  just to have something to do.  then i saw a different you   and  oh  my.    there's so many stories of love   all with the wonders of love.  and so very sad i would be   'cause none belonged to me.  could be it's all for the voice   so i finally let it rest.  sad but i thought that maybe  love wasn't meant for me...    there was love.  there was love.  there was love   on the other  side of the world.    so much love.  so much love.  so much love   on the other  side of the world.    i had known you for quite sometime   and the thought of love never crossed my mind.  it seemed to be on the other side  of the world.    so crazy how things can change your life.  now that love is you  everything is right   and lonliness is the other side  of the world...    ain't it crazy how things can change your life?  now that love is you everything is right   and lonliness is the other side  of the world...    so crazy how things can change your life.  now that love is you

using me?  are you  are you  are you using me?    you pretended like we were friends  i was blinded by sentiment  you complicated what love should be  and i could swear that you're using me    i keep

me  hey talk to me  talk to me  hey talk to me  talk to me    for my money  for my money  for my money  for my money  for my money  for my money   tell the truth   for my money  for my money    are you  are you  are you using me?  are you  are you  are you using me?  are you  are you  are you using me?  are you  are you  are you using me?    for my body  for my body  for my body  for my body

one time  tell me   one time  one time  it's my desire   don't be such a liar   love  what have you done? oh  wow.  i was sure up to now that she was a friend.  i stayed till the end. don't be a fool again.  i once believed that love was fair.  but i don't anymore. she said i'm a bore.  my heart hit the floor.    don't be a fool anymore.  each time around.  i tell myself it's the game of love.  ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love.  well  i've decided i can't let nobody hurt me again.  so i'll say to the end  i just don't want to be a fool.  don't want to be a fool.   said i don't want to be a fool ever again.    whenever a fool's in love he doesn't know he's to blame.  he's caught in the game. it all ends up the same.  he doesn't feel the shame. he looks at love in a diff'rent way.  it breaks his heart ev'rytime they all turn out strange.    but he'll never change. he's never gonna change.  next time around i'll tell myself it'll be better than before  i won't look back.  there'll be no one tearing my heart out anymore.  i just decided i can't let nobody fool me again.  so i'll swear to the end.  i just don't want to be a fool.  don't want to be a fool.   said i don't want to be a fool  ever again   no way   i mean no more  never again  oo  no never   i can't be a fool  can't be. no way. no way. no way. oo.  i don't want to be. i don't want to be a fool. no.  i can't love anybody  i can't love nobody   walking on a one way street.  any way  any way any  way no.   if i don't  if i don't  find somebody  somebody body    that'll be alright with me.  know  i know it'll be alright now   'cause i decided not to let nobody kill me again.  so i'll stay to the end  i just don't want to be a fool.  don't want to be a fool   said i don't want to be a fool.  don't wanna be a fool   ever ever again. don't want to be a fool can't be a fool.  don't want to be a fool ever again.  i don't want to be a fool  never oh never oh never again.   don't want to

clutch  precise can flaunt with this and never too much  it's such a love flow  high but natural  the thug's a no-show  and drugs a no-no  the only thing that they was shootin' was pool  while harlem

good times  no poetry rhymes  they don't know how or when or if or why  why the goodness never stays  or why love didn't come again today    isn't there someone who knows they're in trouble  isn't there someone who sees  i'll be the someone who cares that you're dying for love  i can be the someone that you need    i know you dream at night and lay your feelings down  and you wish your life could be more like your dreams  what a moonlit sound  your voice is not too loud  but somehow i hear it coming through to me  i pray you hang on to your dream  and i hope it gives you all the love you need  you need    isn't there someone who knows that you're hurting  is there someone to believe  well  i'll be the someone who cares that you're dying for love  i can be the someone that you need    don't you miss love  i know i often do  that's why i'm pulling you closer to me  but like anything you can't see  it's just a little harder to believe    isn't there someone who loves you completely  isn't there someone like me  well  i'll be the someone who cares that you're dying for love  i can be the someone that you need  i can be the someone that you need   strumming my pain with his fingers   singing my life with his words   killing me softly with his song   killing me softly with his song   telling my whole life with his words   killing me softly with his song ...    i heard he sang a good song  i heard he had a style.  and so i came to see him to listen for a while.  and there he was this young boy  a stranger to my eyes.    strumming my pain with his fingers   singing my life with his words   killing me softly with his song   killing me softly with his song   telling my whole life with his words   killing me softly with his song ...    i felt all flushed with fever  embarrassed by the crowd   i felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.  i prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on ...    strumming my pain with his fingers   singing my life with his words   killing me softly with his song   killing me softly with his song   telling my whole life with his words   killing me softly with his song ...    he sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair.  and then he looked right through me as if i wasn't there.  but he just came to singing  singing clear and strong.    strumming my pain with his fingers   singing my life with his words   killing me softly with his song   killing me softly with his song   telling my whole life with his words   killing me softly with his song ...    he was strumming  oh  he was singing my song.  killing me softly with his song   killing me softly with his song   telling my whole life with his words   killing me softly with his song ...  with his song ... hey baby  what's your game?  i ask you

it's bitter sweet  you've got to try eight days a week  to create a good enough love to keep  you see hearts belong to fire  so does her love  she burns me up with desire    my girl's love is right on time  "sweet" and "sweet and ever kind"  she's so fine  she doesn't  she doesn't  she don't mind  even when i come home late at night  we don't fuss  we never fight  'cause the girl loves me to the line  she doesn't  she doesn't  she don't mind    it was out of my hands  i did my best  please understand  i was late for one of our evening plans  champagne  dinner for two  with candlelight  she set the mood  but there wasn't anything i could do    but  she is so forgiving  the one thing i know is  it's off her love i'm living    that girl's love is right on time  "sweeter than sweet" and "ever kind"  she's so fine  she doesn't  she doesn't  she don't mind  even when i come home late at night  we don't fuss  we never fight  'cause the girl loves me to the line  she doesn't  she doesn't  she don't mind    when i go out to play  she doesn't mind if i'm a little bit late  she knows i think about her face  till i get home  till i get back home  what we gonna do tonight?  it's raining heavy and it's cold outside  so let's just love until we get things right  and waste a whole lotta time  i don't mind    i tell her things she can't repeat  makes her little heart just skip a beat  she blush a little bit  and then i find  she doesn't  she doesn't  she don't mind    even though our love is "c'est si bon"  sometimes i like to be alone  ring the girl on her private line  she doesn't  she doesn't  she don't mind    go to work early  come back late  outta my head  can't concentrate  sometimes my love is a waste of time but  she doesn't  she doesn't  she don't mind    she's better even than she used to be  loving her is no mystery  sometimes i'm not so sweet and kind  she doesn't  she doesn't  she don't mind    when i call her in the middle of the day  she's busy at work  but it's okay  but not too busy to give me time  she doesn't  she doesn't  she don't mind   what happened  it seems like every time love comes  you're never ready  that's why they call it?  the rush    tell me  are you there?  could it be that you're the answer to my prayer  see  i've prayed for peace and love  like so many of us do  then i prayed to find someone like you  up in the morning  fell out of my bed  worn out  i couldn't sleep  thoughts of you filled my head  how could it be?  this is scaring me    seems every time i try  to rest my heart is when  the rush is back again  maybe this time i'll  make it work somehow  guess i'm gonna find out now    i get a rush  and it's love for sure  what else can it be  something beckons me  and i go back for more  ooo such a rush  can't pass love by  what else can i do  something tells me to  give it one more try    i'm not gonna die if love passes me by  it goes and comes around  i know  so maybe the next time i'll be one of the few  chosen by love to do just what i wanna do  i will carry on wading through every day till love needs me  waiting for the rush to come and find me  i still remember when love was an angel send  it will be back again    i can't remember when  i can't remember how  it's very different now  it's not a fantasy  it's very real to me  true to the touch  i get a rush   don't be discouraged  don't be dismayed  there's hope for all in this world  'cause this is christmas day  say a little prayer for the world  god teach us love  though you think that he doesn't hear  i know he does    this is christmas  let the world sing  let us all begin to heal  hallelujah  this is christmas  and with love we can begin today    christmas bells ring  people's hearts sing  and i forget about all the troubles i seem to have   aand i tell myself to feel how my brother feels  try to love him and maybe then i'll understand him  make a little room in our hearts  no heart's too small  can't we love each other today?  'cause after all    this is christmas  let the world sing  let us all begin to heal  hallelujah  this is christmas  and with love we can begin today    come  come  come see the little one  come  come

hallelujah  this is christmas  and with love we can begin    this is christmas love came to me that day  stayed longer than i planned  but change is good  they say  so i rearranged my world for them  for her and love and  here i go again  i spoke to my heart  said  "open up wide"  then got the message you had changed your mind  and now here i am and i just don't understand  baby  if you talk to me then i will listen  there can't be no "us" honey  if "you" are missin'  yes i love you  yes i need you  ain't no world for me without you  i want you  i'm just too proud to beg  so sad the journey made  so high the price we have to pay  all for love...  and it hurts you anyway  i can't lose my soul to hope and wishing  you don't understand me  i know that you think...  i don't love you  i don't need you  but  my intentions are to love you  see  i want you  i'm just too proud...  to beg for your love  so don't put me through it  take a little time to think about what you're doing  and try to understand why...  yes i love you  yes i need you  ain't no world for me without you  i want you  i'm just too proud to beg  so sad the journey made  so high the price we have to pay  all for love...  and it hurts you anyway   no one knows the side of you that i know  no one gets to see  to feel you  to hear you when they call  i'm the only one you answer  because i know what to do  i know what to do    when i need you  i just close my eyes and i'm with you  and all that i so want to give you  is only a heartbeat away  when i need love  i hold out my hand and i touch love  i never knew there was so much love  keeping me warm night and day    miles and miles of empty space in between us  a telephone can't take the place of your smile  but i won't be traveling forever  it's cold out  but hold out  and do like i do    when i need you  i just close my eyes and i'm with you  and all that i so want to give you  is only a heartbeat away    it's not easy when the road is your driver  but honey that's the heavy load that we bear  but i won't be traveling a lifetime  it's cold out  but hold out  and do like i do  when i need you    but i won't be traveling a lifetime  it's cold out  oh honey  hold out  and do like i do    when i need you  i just close my eyes and i'm with you baby  and all that i so want to give you  is only a heartbeat away    when i need love  i hold out my hand and i touch love  i never knew there was so much love  keeping me warm night and day  honey  when i need you    i'm in a cloud and i'm holding my hand out to you  holding my hand out to you  holding my hand out for you we don't play any games  my girl and i  we get by on the high of love  and there's no time to spend on doubt or wondering  'cause no one else could i ever love  you see the world outside can be cold and very lonely  and it gets real bad  and it makes me sad  but  whether or not the world gets better  you and i and love will be together  together  whether or not the world gets better  you and i will truly survive  and it's all because our love will never die  never ever die  we all live in a crazy world today  there's so much beauty and yet there's so much pain  and we'd be wiser to make a change  with love we could  it's our world  we should make it good  and if the world outside gets too cold and feels too lonely  and it gets real bad  it'll still make us sad  whether or not the world gets better  you and i and love will be together  together  whether or not the world gets better  you and i will truly survive  and it's all because our love will never die  never ever die  our love is out world  and it keeps us safely from anything outside that could hurt us  we look out from inside  and depending on what we see  we just hold each other tightly  hold me tightly  'cause sometimes it's just better to let it be  whether or not the world gets better  you and i and love will be together  together  whether or not the world gets better  you and i will truly survive  and it's all because our love will never die  never ever die   oh  yes  a kiss in the dark  a certain time i can call you  a letter of love  but no name did you sign  pretending to all  that we were just friends when i saw you  i didn't know that you wanted me to be  i didn't know that you wanted me for your   for your  to be    your secret love  why can't we tell somebody  'cause secret

the thought had still remained  girl he must be insane  how could he treat you that way  oh    just 'cause he wants to make love  doesn't mean that he's in love with you  and i really hope you hear me this time  maybe one day you'll wake up  then you'll have to face up to the truth    i don't want to be a hater  but he really needs to raise up off you  and i hope you understand it tonight  i don't

real deep inside  you'll realize you should be mine    just 'cause he wants to make love  doesn't mean that he's in love with you  won't you try to understand me tonight  maybe one day you'll wake up  then you'll have to face up to the truth    i don't want to be a hater  but he really needs to raise up off you  girl  i swear that what i'm saying it right  i don't care what it takes girl  there's too much at stake girl  i'll come for you anytime  to bring your heart to mine    just 'cause he wants to make love  doesn't mean that he's in love with you  i really hope you hear me tonight  maybe one day you'll wake up  and give me your love  it's killing me but i'm trying  to bring your heart to mine he works hard to give her all he thinks she wants  but it tears her apart 'cause nothing's for her heart  he pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight  if he could only read her mind  she'd say     buy me a rose  call me from work  open a door for me what would it hurt?  show me you love me by the look in your eyes  these are the little things  i need the most in my life    yeah    now the days have grown  to years of feeling all alone  as she sits and wonders if all she's doin' is wrong  cos lately she'd try anything just to turn his head  would it make a difference if she'd say  if she'd say    buy me a rose  call me from work  open the door for me what would it hurt?  show me you love me by the look in your eyes  these are the little things  i need the most in my life    and the more that he lives  the less that he tries  to show her the love that he holds inside  and the more that she gives  the more that he sees  this is the story of you  and me    so i bought you a rose  on the way home from work  to open the door to a heart that i hurt  and i hoped you noticed this look in my eyes  cause im gonna make things right  for the rest of your life rest of your life   and i'm gonna hold you tonight  tonight  do all those little things  for the rest of your life quarter after seven  got a phone call  telling me to get here quick  said your girl is in a bad situation  they don't know if she's gonna make it    as i hurry to be by her side  i ask a thousand times  why oh why  there's no rhyme or reason in my life  with you lying here this way    i'd give anything just to trade places with you  so i'm begging heaven down on my knees  to help you make it through    tell me can heaven wait  can heaven wait just one more night  tell me what it's gonna take  to keep you with me in my life    giving up the shame of my other life  now i'm seeing things in

who was loving you  baby  the only tears you'd cry would be tears of joy  and if i was by your side  you'd never know one lonely night  if it was my arms you were running to  i'd give you love in these arms of mine  if i was the one in your life  if i could have just one wish  i'd wish that you were mine  i would hold you near  kiss away those tears  i'd be so good to you  baby  you're the one

no make-up surely  i wasn't gonna let her get away  until she heard me say    excuse me miss  what's your name  where are you from  and i come and possibly  can i take you out tonight  to a movie  to the park  i'll have you home before it's dark  so let me know  can i take you out tonight    don't care if i get rejected  at least then i won't regret it  regret the fact i missed the chance  for romance at least  i walk away knowing i tried my best  and i'm going  i'm going on with my day  cause at least she heard me say    excuse me miss  what's your name  where are you from  and i come and possibly  can i take you out tonight  to a movie  to the park  i'll have you home before it's dark  so let me know  can i take you out tonight    excuse me miss  what's your name  where are you from  and i come and possibly  can i take you out tonight  to a movie  to the park  i'll have you home before it's dark  so let me know  can i take you out tonight    that's why i had to come over  and introduce myself to you  cause you never gonna know  when you're gonna find love  and hopefully i'll find it in you    excuse me miss  what's your name  where are you from  and i come and possibly  can i take you out tonight  to a movie  to the park  i'll have you home before it's dark  so let me know  can i take you out tonight   so close to paradise  but closer than i should be  it's like i'm along for the ride  it happened unexpectedly  promised myself that i wouldn't ever love again  but you make me feel something  my mind's always on you  i was standing in the rain  i thought about you   i was riding on the train  i thought about you   feeling high like i seem to do  every time i think about you  saw two lovers start to kiss  i thought about you   had to hold back the tears  i thought about you   other girls no more exist  all because i think about you  nothing seems to help  i don't even know myself  i'm trying not to think of you  but a heart does what it wants to do  pass you by  see you smile and i must admit i get  so emotional  i think i'm falling for you  bought a pillow for my room  i thought about you   heard alicia sing a tune  i thought about you   it sends my rocket to the moon  every time i think about you  right from this heart of mine  i thought about you   i wanted you every time  i thought about you   what i feel is so divine  and it's all because i think about you  but i'm constantly reminded  reminded that you're only someone who i'd like to know  you don't know me  you're my private fantasy  you're with me  constantly in my mind  had a lovely day today  i thought about you   wasn't hard to get through  i thought about you   seems to happen easily  every time i think about you  took a walk with myself  i thought about you   wish it could've been with you  i thought about you   but every star in the sky came out for me  and it's all because i think about you   back when i was a child  before life removed all the innocence  my father would lift me high  and dance with my mother and me  and then  spin me around 'till i fell asleep  then up the stairs he would carry me  and i knew for sure  i was loved    if i could get another chance  another walk  another dance with him  i'd play a song that would never ever end  how i'd love love love  to dance with my father again    when i and my mother  would disagree  to get my way i would run  from her to him  he'd make me laugh just to comfort me  yeah yeah  then finally make me do  just what my mama said  later that night when i was asleep  he left a dollar under my sheet  never dreamed that he  would be gone from me    if i could steal one final glance  one final step  one final dance with him  i'd play a song that would never ever end  cause i'd love love love to  dance with my father again    sometimes i'd listen outside her door  and i'd hear how mama would cry for him  i'd pray for her even more than me  i'd pray for her even more than me    i know i'm praying for much to much  but could you send her  the only man she loved  i know you don't do it usually  but dear lord  she's dying to dance with my father again    every night i fall asleep  and this is all i ever dream oh yeah  oh  oh yeah    what good is the money  when lately we've been missing each other  cause we've got work and kids  you know how it goes  monday through friday  nine to

say  she could give you the world  but she'll never love you the way  that i love you  baby    you can go any place you want  to fancy clubs and restaurants  but i can only watch you with her  my nose pressed up against the window pane  the window pane  oh yeah  yeah    i  who have nothing  nothing  i  who have no one  must watch you  i will watch you  baby  go passing by  but you don't see me  wrapped in the arms of  wrapped in the arms of somebody else  when darling it's i  who  really loves you  baby  really loves you  baby  i'm the one  i'm the one  i'm the one    i want to be the one that you just can't live without  i want to be the one that you never feel no doubt  i want to be the one that you let give you the lovin'  but  i have nothing  nothing    i want to be the one that you always want to be near  i want to say the words that your body and soul need to hear  i want to be the one that you let give you all the lovin'  but i have nothing i thought sometime alone  was what we really needed  you said this time would hurt more than it helps  but i couldn't see that  i thought it was the end  of a beautiful story  and so i left the one i loved at home to be alone alone   and i tried to find  out if this one thing is true  that i'm nothing without you  i know better now  and i've had a change of heart    i'd rather have bad times with you  than good times with someone else  i'd rather be beside you in a storm  than safe and warm by myself  i'd rather have hard times together  than to have it easy apart  i'd rather have the one who holds my heart  whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah    and then i met someone  and thought she could replace you  we got a long just fine  we wasted time because she was not you  we had a lot of fun  though we knew we were faking  love was not impressed with our connection they were all lies  all lies  so i'm here cause i found this one thing is true  that i'm nothing without you  i know better now  and i've had a change of heart    i'd rather have bad times with you  than good times with someone else  i'd rather be beside you in a storm  than safe and warm by myself  i'd rather have hard times together  than to have it easy apart  i'd rather have the one who holds my heart  who holds my heart    i can't blame you if you turn away from me  like i've done you   i can only prove the things i say with time   please be mine     i'd rather have bad times with please be mine  you   than good times with someone else i know   i'd rather be beside you in a storm anytime    than safe and warm by myself so sure baby   i'd rather have hard times to gether   than to have it easy apart  i'd rather have the one who holds my heart my heart     i'd rather have bad times with you surely    than good times with someone else surely   i'd rather be beside you in a storm oh yeah    than safe and warm by myself all by myself   i'd rather have hard times together   than to have it easy apart you know it   i'd rather have the one who holds my heart    i'd rather have the one who holds my heart  i'd rather have the one who holds my heart  whooo who holds my heart i think sometimes i can read your mind  when you make things up i can tell you lie  i see the things that your man can't see  and i wonder what kind of man is he  the one who you say is your lover  who you insist takes care of you under the covers  and who is there for you and loves you like no other  then you kiss and tell me that you love me like a brother      if i didn't know better  i'd think that you were mine  you're with me all the time  if i didn't know better  i'd swear we're more than friends  you're touching me again  if i didn't know better  i'd think we were in love  girl  do you want to tell me something  oh  oh  oh  i could be wrong about the things you say  but i don't rub up on my friends that way  you tell me that you've always been a flirt  but if it goes wrong  i could get hurt  but no  you insist it's harmless playin'  it's just a part of who you are  that it's just your nature  and that it's fine  you know i'm a friend  it's really nothing  you say that i'm just like a  that i'm just like a brother        my idea of a friend is when you  do a lotta things together and have a lotta fun  but my definition of love is different  you touch and hold each other  and you only want to be alone clinging to each other  like you and he should be  but like you and i are  well  i know it sounds crazy but     i see the way he treats you  i feel the tears you cry  and it makes me sad and it makes me mad  there's nothin' i can do  baby  'cause your lover is my best friend  and i guess that's where the story ends  so i've gotta try to keep it inside  you'll never be  never be mine    but if i was the one who was loving you  baby  the only tears you'd cry would be tears of joy  and if i was by your side  you'd never know one lonely night    if it was my arms you were running to  i'd give you love in these arms of mine  if i was the one in your life    if i could have just one wish  i'd wish that you were mine  i would hold you near  kiss away those tears  i'd be so good to you  baby  you're the one i want next to me  but i guess that's just not meant to be  he's there in your life  he's sharing your nights  i'll never be  never be  never be right    but if i was the one who was loving you  baby  the only tears you'd cry would be tears of joy  and if i was by your side  you'd never know one lonely night    i want to reach out and feel you beside me  beside me  right here  right now  right beside me baby  baby  and take you in my arms right now  and scream i love you right out loud  and then someday i'll pray i'll find  i'll find the strength to turn to you and say    but if i was the one who was loving you  baby  the only tears you'd cry would be tears of joy  and if i was by your side  you'd never know one lonely night    if i was the one  if i was the one  the one  if i was the one in your life you talk about me as if i'm not there  you don't even whisper 'cause you just don't care  i stand there and listen to my life go by  and at times i wonder why i even try    well i try because i like to finish what i start  and i have faith it can get better tomorrow  but it won't if you keep treating me  like i'm invisible    say that you won't treat me  the way you're treating me  say that you won't  i see you but you just keep looking right through me  like someone you don't even see  like i'm invisible    you brag to your friends how much i must want ya  you said i was someone you could do with or without  you're so confident that i'd never leave you  no wonder you're surprised that i am walking out    well  i have to leave no matter how sad it might be  because this hurt's become my reality  and i won't let you keep on treating me  like i'm invisible    say that you won't treat me  the way you're treating me  say that you won't  i see you but you just keep looking right through me  like someone you don't even see  like i'm invisible    well i finally got the nerve to move on  'cause a fly kind of guy like me  surely deserves more  much more  my new love can see what's inside of me  and she told me to thank you  for the good love that you blew  and oh    i wish you could see the way she looks at me  she don't keep me insecure or treat me lovelessly  she don't hide me from her friends when we have company  and she never ever makes me feel  like i'm invisible    and after we lay here  she wants me to stay here  i'm not just for making love then expected to leave  i'm not only someone used for helping her ends meet  and she'd never ever walk on by me  like i'm invisible    like i'm invisible learn to love and you learn to survive  my mistake was thinking love wouldn't catch me  it was the story of my life  i awakened seeing with new eyes  i begged forgiveness  but love wouldn't hear me  taught you to fear me  baby    love forgot we used to be just fine  and love forgot about the tender times  love forgot to ask you if you'd want to give me  give me one more try  maybe love forgot this time    love can't love someone who breaks a vow  but i was not myself  my heart wasn't in it  i still loved you every minute  i could fix it if you show me how  you didn't hear it from somebody else  i told you  praying you'd let me hold you     i can't believe  love forgot the power to forgive   impossible  and love forgot that we depend on it   it couldn't be  love forgot that it's the only way  our poetry will ever rhyme  i think love forgot this time    but who would have ever known  i'd ever be tempted  but i'm hopin'  love will show me what to do  'cause if it was all so easy  then anybody else coulda shown me  i don't understand how you wouldn't know  i never even meant it     i can't believe  did love forget this was the only time   impossible  did love forget i tried to set things right   it couldn't be  did love forget to remember  that regret lives in this heart of mine  maybe love forgot this time     i can't believe  love forgot the power to forgive   impossible  and love forgot that we depend on it   it couldn't be  love forgot that it's the only way  that poetry will ever rhyme  maybe love forgot this time    did you forget this time  did you forget this time  don't forget me now  don't forget me now  did you forget somehow  did you forget somehow i need to have you next to me in more ways than one  and i refuse to leave till i see the mornin' sun    the time is right  you hold me tight  and love's got me high  please tell me  'yes' and don't say  'no'  honey  not tonight    move a little close to me  you owe it to yourself  and i will selfishly take a little for myself  and it's because of you  that love won't let me wait    yeah  yeah    the time is right  turn down the lights  and take my hand  ooh  ooh  yeah  we'll take a flight and spend the night  in wonderland    and i need to have you next to me in more ways than one  and i refuse to leave till i see the mornin' sun  creep through your window pane  because love won't let me wait  not another minute    ooh  ooh  ooh  yeah  yeah    and i need your love so desperately and only you can set me free  when i make to you  we'll explode in ecstasy  and i won't take the blame  that love won't let me wait    love won't  no  no  no  love won't  no  no  no  no  no  no  no   love won't let me wait     yeah  yeah  love won't  i said   love won't let me wait     my baby  my temperature's risin'  ooh   love won't let me wait  won't let me    not another minute   love won't let me wait  won't let me    baby  baby   i can't wait  i can't wait  i can't wait  i can't wait  i can't wait  i can'twait   i can't wait  no  no  no  can't wait   wait  no way  no way  no  no  no  no  no way  no way  no  no   doo ooh   ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh yeah   wait  i cant wait not another minute  not another minute  i can't wait  i can't wait  i'll be there  i can't wait yes  i will  i'll be there if you always do what you've always done  you'll always get the same old stuff  life can treat you good  then turn as cold as ice  and believe me when i tell you    this thing called love  for sure  is like most things in life  not all bad  not all good  it's just something that i believe   not all cold  not all hot  yeah  i like that   not all bitter  not all sweet  sounds all right to me     so don't miss all the good  waiting for the best  there's still happiness  right in the middle  perfect love sounds real nice  but that never seemed to happen with any relationship of mine  it was always up and down  in then out  and after the last goodbye  i still didn't know what it was all about  you get disappointed if it ain't bliss all the time    and you get so annoyed if you can't feel the same every night  not all bad  not all good  i'm tryin' to tell you that it's   not all high  not all low  not all high and not all low   not all heaven  not all hell  as far as i can tell     it's not some prize you win  you don't have a thing to prove  just enjoy thegroove  right in the middle  cause i've learned when it comes to love  it's the exact same reality  that's why they say "que sera  sera"  which means whatever's gonna be is gonna be    whatever's gonna be is gonna be:  not all bad  not all good  i need somebody to understand   not all sunshine  not all rain   you know that too much of a good thing is really no good   not all laughter  not all tears  i'm only trying to tell you     to let your good times roll  keep your self-control  there's a lot of soul  right in the middle i hope you hear this 'cause i'm about to say it now  guess i'm to blame and it's just a shame  cause i had the chance to tell you what you meant  but i lived my life thinking i had time  and that in my mind i'd get to it    now you've gone away  not a single day goes by  when i don't think about it  your spirit's all around  i can say it now  i hope you hear this    now it's a shame that i found out the hard way  and it ain't the same  cause you never ever got to hear me say  that i love you  'cause i waited too late  so oh  i've got to tell everybody  don't make the same mistake      it's alright to say i love you out loud  and it's all good  so don't you keep it inside  let it out  do it today  no no no  don't you wait  cause it just might be too late  to say i love you    don't walk a mile inside my shoes  cause if you do  you're gonna regret it  don't take it lightly thinking they might be  here or there tomorrow    why you want to wait  communicate  don't assume that they already know  how much  how much you're really feeling  and you really  really love them    now it's a shame that i found out the hard way  and it ain't the same  cause you never ever got to hear me say  that i love you  'cause i waited too late  it's like i would tell anybody  don't make the same mistake like i did        those three words make all the difference in the world  you might wait and miss your chance  so don't be scared to say what you're feeling  you can't turn back the hands of time  if you get the chance  do it right  let it out  say it now  say it    [chorus: x2]    i'm ready  ready to shout it out  shout it out loud  so ready  oh how i wish i could tell you right now  but i waited too late  so today i won't make the same mistake  no  i won't do it  and if i get the chance i'll say it    [chorus: x3]    it's alright why did you tell your girlfriend you were hanging with the boys  she called me last night and i tried to cover for ya  she asked if i liked the flick that we all went out to see  i said  "ooo uh  it was nice"  she said  "don't you lie to me"  you messed up you shoulda warned me first  she saw you   i'm sad to tell ya  you shoulda told me 'cause you made it worse  she saw you  unlucky fella  you better take that credit card  she saw you  to cartier  you better hope with all you got  she saw you   she feels like forgiving you today  too bad for you  you were out there trying to be a player  now she's gone  it's true  it's hard to feel that sorry for you  she saw you  now this is the end  saw you kiss the very girl  who's supposed to be  only your friend  she's convinced you took her heart  and played with it like a toy  and from what i heard  you just might need you a lawyer  it's too late for feeling bad  you did not respect the girl  you tried to play around  and got caught with your pants down  you can't escape from what you've done  she saw you  your time is up  you're like a deer who's caught up in  she saw you  the headlights of love  you can't be too proud to plead  she saw you  she's gonna make you pay  forgiveness is what you need  she saw you  she's too mad to let you get away  looks bad to me  you were busy trying to be a player  now she's gone  breathe deep  you can't be doing that creep  creep  creep  creep  she saw you  now this is the end  saw you kiss the very girl  who's supposed to be  only your friend goodbye  so long  were the last words from you  seems like you're over  all the goodness we knew    you think that you're strong  you think that you don't  you don't need no one  well  i was talkin' to some of your friends  just to see how everyone was doin'  and they said you needed me    said it was something you'd never admit  but it was hard to see you going through it  they said you needed me  guess i'll suffer 'til i'm where i belong  i'm under the pressure  but i'll keep being strong    you say that you're strong  you say that you don't need anyone  what in the world are you telling your friends  i get confused every time i see them  they said you needed me    i know the people talk just for the thrill  but the fact of the matter is still  they said you needed me  take your time  re-invent your mind  you'll feel better  you'll feel stronger  then decide if i'm in your life  for forever or longer    you think that you're strong  you think that you don't  you don't need no one  well  i was talkin' to some of your friends  just to see how everyone was doin'  and they said you needed me    said it was something you'd never admit

sixteen  i just had to be a man at any cost  i volunteered for vietnam  where i got my leg shot off  i recall a quote form a movie that said: "who's more a man  than a man with a reason that's worth dyin' for?"      they had me standing on the front line  they had me standing on the front line  they had me standing on the front line  but now i stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead    they gave me a uniform and a tiny salty pill  to stop the big urge i might have for the wrong kind of thrill  they put a gun in my hand and said "shoot until he's dead."  but it's hard to kill when 'please  i'm your friend' echoes through your head  brought up in church taught no man should take another's life  but then put in the jungle where life has no price  no        back in the world  the paper reads today  another war is in the brewing  but what about the lives of yesterday  and the many happy families that have been ruined?  my niece is a hooker  and my nephew's a junkie too  but they say i have no right to tell them how they should do  they laugh and say quit braggin' 'bout the war you should have never been in  but my mind is so brain-washed i'd probably go back and do it again  i walk the neighborhood  parading my purple heart  with a fear of agent orange that no one will stop  no    [chorus x 2]    would you believe i do?     her parents said  girl

knew someday i'd need  but i kept saying girl you're wrong  go home    long days  short nights when you're on the road  for a pretty girl it's a heavy load  and even so who'll pay your fare  she said i'll make it on a wing and a prayer    she only wanted to be close to me  to give me the love she knew someday i'd need  but i kept saying girl you're wrong  go home    she said i've on right to tell her how life should be  especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me  but she agreed to go along with my final word    as fate would have life come around  my world started tumbling down  i lost my family  my friends and job  and set free the only one who stuck with me from the start    she only wanted to be close to me  to give me the love she knew someday i'd need  but i kept saying girl you're wrong  go home    she said i've on right to tell her how life should be  especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me  but she agreed to go along with my

if you're ready to step off the edge into eternity  we can step right off the edge into eternity   repeat  never been too much for watching  cause there's too many things to view  and when eyes begin to wander  they more than likely never get through  but beyond my own temptation  i'm enticed by what i see  and i won't feel satisfaction  until she's where i want her to be    i gotta have you  i gotta have you  i gotta have you for me  you are a sight for sore eyes to see  i gotta make you my reality  i gotta have you  i gotta have you  i gotta have you for me  you are a sight for sore eyes to see  come on girl  make you my reality    never been too much for talking  cause there's too many things to say  and by the time that i start speaking  the right moment has slipped away  but i must break this old tradition  and try to muster up the words  and though someone else may have said them  i'll say them in way you've never heard    i gotta have you  i gotta have you  i gotta have you for me  you are a sight for sore eyes to see  i've gotta make you my reality  i gotta have you  i gotta have you  i gotta have you for me  you are a sight for sore eyes to see  come on girl  make you my reality  gotta be  gotta be  gotta be reality  baby  gotta be  gotta be  gotta be reality  baby   repeat     never been too much for touching  cause there's too many things to feel  plus there's too much disappointment  when you find out those feelings ain't real  but here's a time when inner senses  are gonna have to shine the light  cause i have overly committed  myself in thinking that you're alright    i gotta have you  i gotta have you  i gotta have you for me  you are a sight for sore eyes to see  i gotta make you my reality  i gotta have you  i gotta have you  i gotta have you for me  you are a sight for sore eyes to see  come on girl  make you my reality  gotta be  gotta be  gotta be reality  baby  gotta be  gotta be  gotta be reality  baby   repeat  no new year's day to celebrate  no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away  no first of spring  no song to sing  in fact here's just another ordinary day    no april rain  no flowers bloom  no wedding saturday within the month of june  but what it is  is something true  made up of these three words that i must say to you    i just called to say i love you  i just called to say how much i care  i just called to say i love you  and i mean it from the bottom of my heart    no summer's high  no warm july  no harvest moon to light one tender august night    no autumn breeze  no falling leaves  not even time for birds to fly to southern skies    no libra sun  no halloween  no giving thanks to all the christmas joy you bring  but what it is  though old so new  to fill your heart like no three words could ever do    i just called to say i love you  i just called to say how much i care  i do  i just called to say i love you  and i mean it from the bottom of my heart    i just called to say i love you  i just called to say how much i care  i do  i just called to say i love you  and i mean it from the bottom of my heart  of my heart  of my heart    i just called to say i love you  i just called to say how much i care  i do  i just called to say i love you  and i mean it from the bottom of my heart  of my heart  baby of my heart my love is gone with yesterday  my love is gone  with yesterday    we had a love for all seasons  at least that's how it used to be  there was no time  space  or reason  more special to us than we    my love continued to flourish  as a flower blooms in spring  then you tried to play love for silly  but the loser is the fool who doesn't play  love by the rules    if she breaks your heart  i will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you  cause i may not be around to do the things  i used to do  and if you awake to find you're lost  i will send a glad star to lead you on your way  cause the love i felt inside  has gone away with yesterday    my love is gone with yesterday  my love is gone  with yesterday    there was a time when forever  was common-place for me and you  laughing  loving  sharing  caring  seemed to be made just for us two  but i kept on building the dream world  that i thought was you and i  sorry  i'm sadly mistaken  cause our castle in the sky  has turned into a mere goodbye    well if she breaks your heart  i will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you  cause i may not be around to do the things  i used to do  and if you awake to find you're lost  i will send a glad star to lead you on your way  cause the love i felt inside  has gone away with yesterday  has gone away with yesterday    my love is gone away with yesterday  my love is gone  with yesterday  my love is gone away with yesterday  my love is gone  with yesterday try to envision you as the oldest living someone  being every night and day all alone  going through ages and ages  places and spaces  with never finding that someone to call your own    like a treasure chest of dreams long forgotten  hidden for good in a stolen lost and found  but just when fate was calling quits  love appeared in the midst of despair  came and turned your life around    i'm new  new like the first day of spring  new like a nightingale that's just learned to sing  i'm new  new like the very start of dawn  like a child that's first born with your love  i'm new    you're standing amongst a crowd of six billion people  crying out for help  but no one understands  'cause much to your dismay  you've been taken far away  to a land where joy is pain and sorrow's a happy man    where an aching heart's the sign of the mighty  and a love-filled heart looks down upon with fault and shame  but at the very instant all was through  lady lucks appears  says "love cando"  and changed you like a christian who's been born again    i'm new  new like the fresh morning dew  new like a work of art that's finally through  i'm new  new like a first flight of a dove  so safe and secure with your love  i'm new    love took a long time coming to me  but i've gotta say  i owe my thanks to him for sending you my way  hey    'cause i'm new  new like the first winter snow  like the start of forever  with infinity to go  i'm new  new like the birth of the sun  forever young i will be    'cause with your love  i'm new  new like from a restful night of sleep  new like a starving man that's had food to eat    i'm new  nothing compares nor can compete  sharing with you the sweetness of your love  i'm new well   don't you know i'm wondering  little girl  i'm wondering

feel so insecure  in my mind  i can picture  losing you for sure  and the pain i can't endure    oh baby i'm wondering  little girl  i'm wondering  how can i make you love me  a little more than you

those silly things kids do at ten  but the crossfire i was caught in  should not have been in the first place  a dropped monte carlo came to a screech  someone yelled "nobody gets away with dissin' me"  across the street a man pulled his nine  everybody started to run  a shower of bullets rang out  mistakenly my life was done  oh    my love is with you where ever you are  my love is with you  where ever you are  repeat     though my life they've taken  they can't take what we've shared  spread the love i've given  i'll be there    my love is with you where ever you are  my love is with you  where ever you are  repeat     when you're joyful  when you're lonely  when you're happy  when tears are streamin' right down your face  in the morning  in the noon time  in the evening  in the wee wee hours of the nighttime hour  in the summer  in the springtime  in the autumn  in the cold long winter  winter nights  my love is with you  my love is with you my best friend  my love is with you

jungle fever  we've got jungle fever  we're in love  i've gone white-girl crazy  she's gone black-boy hazy  we're each other's baby  we're in love i've seen you  i saw you  i see you  without little notice  if any at all  of you knowing me watchin' you  you walking  you talking  you smiling  you styling in everything your body wears  and that's not just a point of view  they're painting  they're ranting  they're raving  about miss lovely got it going on  from head down to her toes  and no one knows better than i know  cause i've been listening to the spirit of  your body  mind and soul    it's a sensuous whisper  that makes my body weak  it's that sensuous whisper  that's sweeter than the sweetest sweet  it's that sensuous whisper  that makes my psyche say  ooh we  ooh wee  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we    can feel you  can smell you  can taste you  though my senses never had the pleasure of  that lovely wonderment  but i start to shaking  i shiver  to think that little sparkle in your eye  means you are giving me some kind of hint  i'm ready  i'm willing  i'm able  in fact those words are at the tip of my tongue  eagerly waiting for me to say  then you smile and whisper "how are you?"  but when i move my lips and try to speak the words just go away    it's a sensuous whisper  that makes my body weak  it's that sensuous whisper  that's sweeter than the sweetest sweet  it's that sensuous whisper  that makes my psyche say  ooh wee  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we    it's that sensuous whisper that's got me trippin' out  it's that sensuous whisper  that i don't want to do without  it's that sensuous whisper  that makes me want to shout  ooh we  ooh wee  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we    i don't even care how long it takes  as long as i have you lying next to me  cause to wait forever and a day  is a small price to pay if it's you i'm getting  if it's you i'm getting  i'm not quitting  and that is how i'm living    i'm clinging  not dreaming  but scheming  with my nose against the grind and both my eyes focused upon the prize  i think it  i trust it  i know it  your love that i've longed for is gonna be mine  good things do come in time  i'm right on the rhythm you're givin'  but this is more than giving up some casual mental telepathy  the music  the candles  the champagne and all that's needed  is one thing to give it authenticity    it's a sensuous whisper  that makes my body weak  it's that sensuous whisper  that's sweeter than the sweetest sweet  it's that sensuous whisper  that makes my psyche say  ooh wee  ooh wee  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we    it's that sensuous whisper  that's got me trippin' out  it's that sensuous whisper  that i don't want to do without  it's that sensuous whisper  that makes me want to shout  ooh we  ooh wee  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we    it's a sensuous whisper  that makes my body rock  it's that sensuous whisper  that makes me beg baby don't ever stop  it's that sensuous whisper  that always get me hot  baby  ooh wee  ooh wee  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we    it's that sensuous whisper  that makes me feel alright  it's that sensuous whisper  that keep me wanting you morning  noon and every single night  it's that sensuous whisper  don't want you out of my sight  baby  ooh we  ooh wee  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we  ooh we    it's that sensuous whisperyou can't say we shall and not fight through hell  you can't say we will and not dare to deal  you can't shout out peace and then vanish in the crowd  you can't ride the storm without some effect  you can't steal the spoil and not pay the debt  you can't wave a sign that spells "evil" and feel really proud  you can't sing a song with no melody  you can't say we're one without unity  you can't form a line if you're sacred to stand alone  you can't pray for grace and then smack her face  you can't speak of hope and then crack a joke    you can say you're there but time knows how much you've grown  put a face to your somebody    can you say your name?  or would you rather stay unknown?  can you show your face?  or are you fearful of it shown?  can you feel your heart?  or does it beat for you alone?  lift your glass up high  say that your truth will never lie  if your love cannot be moved    you can't look at me and not see yourself  you can't say "for them" and not for who else  you can't truly bless and not bless the good of all  you can't serve the rich and desert the poor  you can't hear their cries and just close the door  you can't say you're down and not take it to the wall  you can't benefit from one's detriment  you can't find the serum and not cure the sick  you can't free the slave to enslave them differently  you can't see the right only from your sight  you can't see the wrong and just go along  or is that the way you would want your fate to read  put a face to your somebody    can you say your name?  or would you rather stay unknown?  can you show your face?  or are you fearful of it shown?  can you feel your heart?  or does it beat for you alone?  lift your glass up high  say that your truth will never lie  if your love cannot be moved    you can't make a pledge and then slip the script  you can't say the words and not move your lips  you can't be confused and still say you understand  you can't be a friend but not through thin and thick  you can't be a click but in danger split  you can't evenly share and then grab the biggest hand  you can't say you do but then show you don't  you can't say you will and make sure you won't  you can't want for change and not do what you need to do    you can't give up all and then take back all you give  you can't live to die but you can die to live  or is that too much to ask of the you in you?  put a face to your somebody    can you say your name?  or would you rather stay unknown?  can you show your face?  or are you fearful of it shown?  can you feel your heart?  or does it beat for you alone?  lift your glass up high  say that your truth will never lie  if your love cannot be moved look at how they stop and

anxiously waiting foe the sun to go in  and the clouds to burst again  to give us  raindrops  passionate raindrops  the kind of rain that writes they're  so in love on our skin  raindrops  that we

the bright side  when there's so much going on down the other side  it's like i live in a bubble with no trouble  and problems don't exist  i chuckle and tell them that ain't the case at all  it goes way back to the time when i was very small  not in mind but size and age my papa use to say  you can always look at the negative  but you should always live in the positive  so i try everyday to live that way  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  some people live in what was and what they could have been  as opposed to living in a what is and how much they can  and be the first to complain about nothing in life going their way  the attitude is "that i can't do nothing 'bout"  and very happy with just breathing in and out  the ones that when you say "lets go make a difference"  they'll say "naw that's ok"  so i don't waste time on the trip side  'cause i do know the real on the flipside  and i'm crystal clear everyday that's why i say  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  when i see the morning  and the sun is smiling down upon me  i joy in the blessing  that still the ground is not above me  and for the people  that i can truly say do love me  i feel  positivity  'cause that's what life's meant to be  positivity  'cause this day did not have to be  some ask me why i'm such an optimist  when it's more fashionable be a pessimist  from what's in seventy-five percent of what we read  hear and view  well i use to have a friend named minnie riperton  who use to always say when she was living  "like fine wine i like seeing the glass of life as half full than half empty"  i'm saying sometimes life can't be rough  but never to the point of me saying i've had enough  long as my heart beats i ain't giving up  that's why i say everyday  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  when people ask me as an african american  what do i see for tomorrow in the human plan?  is it possible for all the people of the world to co-exist?  i say unity is only as big as our vision  and if its narrow  try to expand beyond the horizon  but true leaders must guide us through the ills of society  that stands in our way  so if the road is to harmony  be with the call  but if its about discord  don't take the ride at all  'cause the world vision i see is the one-we for everybody  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  when i see the morning  and the sun is smiling down upon me  just joy in the blessing  that still the ground is not above me  and for the people  that you can truly say do love you  do feel  positivity  'cause that's what life's meant to be  positivity  and that's the energy the world needs  positivity  'cause that's what life means to me  positivity  'cause this day did not have to be  positivity  'cause that's what life's meant to be  positivity  'cause that's the energy the world needs  positivity  'cause that's what life's meant to be  positivity  and this day did not have to be  positivity  'cause that's what life means to me  positivity  and that's the energy the world needs  positivity  'cause that's what life's meant to be  positivity  and that's the energy the world needs   when the lights are down  and the stage is bare  and no more magic's in the air  there's not a friend in sight to care  your tears no one will share  i'll be your comfort through your pain  i'll be your shelter in the rain  when your sad is bad and your bad is worst  and there's no who to turn to first  when you've done everything you can  no one's there to take your hand  i'll be you comfort through your pain  i'll be your shelter in the rain  when you've looked around  and haven't seen me anywhere  though when you were down  i lifted you up from there  there isn't a thing you can ask of me  i won't do  just you put your trust in me  my love will see you through  when the final candle's flickered out  "why me" is all you can think about  when all your joy has disappeared  your future isn't clear  i'll be you comfort through your pain  i'll be your shelter in the rain  when all the odds say there's no chance  amidst the final dance  i'll be you comfort through your pain  i'll be your shelter in the rain  i'll be you comfort through your pain  yes  i'll be your shelter in the rain  rain  i'll be your shelter   be your shelter  be your shelter in the rain   skeletons in your closet  itchin' to

gettin' ready to blow  it's gettin' ready to show  somebody shot off at the mouth and  we're gettin' ready to know    it's gettin' ready to drop  it's gettin' ready to shock  somebody done turned up the heater  an'a it's gettin' ready to pop    crevices in your pantry  now what do we have in here  havin' a daytime nightmare  has always been your biggest fear    oh things are gettin' real crucial  up the old wazoo  yet you cry  why am i the victim?  when the culprit's why-o-you    what did your mama tell you about lies  she said it wasn't polite to tell a white one  what did your daddy tell you about lies  he said one white one turns into a black one    so  it's gettin' ready to blow  it's gettin' ready to show  somebody shot off at the mouth and  we're gettin' ready to know    it's gettin'

brimstone  and you're gettin' ready to burn    it's gettin' ready to shake  you're gettin' ready to ache  somebody done snitched to the news crew  and it's gettin' ready to break    you're gettin' ready to lie  they're gettin' ready to spy  somebody's been put on the hot seat  and you're gettin' ready to fry if i'm caught at a dance party without my dancin' shoes  and everybody dances on my bare feet  shame on me  if i'm mindin' my business just doin' the right thing  and you try to front me off in the street  shame on you  if a family's waiting for that special blessing to  come their way  but they ain't tryin' to get on their knees and pray  shame on them  and if we live in a time where every nation's fightin'  'round the world  yet we can't all agree that peace is the way

shame on me  if you're locked in a marriage and your other half  just gives you abuse  yet you've convinced yourself that there's no way out  shame on you  if we're jammin' the music and somebody's got the  audacity  to say that they can jam it better than us  shame on them  and should there be just a handful that believe that  we are totally free  and there's no need to fight for equality     we have time for racism  we have time for criticism  held bondage by our ism's  when will there be a time to love    we make time to debate religion  passing bills and building prisons  for building fortunes and passing judgments  when will there be a time to love    at this point in history we have a choice to make  to either walk a path of love  or be crippled by our hate    we have time to cause pollution  we have time to cause confusion  all wrapped up in our own illusions  when will there be a time to love    we make time to conquer nations  time for oil exploration  hatred  violence and terrorism  when will there be a time to love    at this moment in time  we have a choice to make  father god is watching  while we cause mother earth so much pain  it's such a shame    not enough money for  the young  the old and the poor  but for war there is always more  when will there be a time to love    we make time for paying taxes  or paying bills and buying status  but we will pay the consequences  if we don't make the time to love    now's the time to pay attention  yes now is the time to love  a time love  love  a time to love  please  please won't you tell me  when will there be

got to get up early  her clothes are old but never are they dirty  living just enough  just enough for the city    her brother's smart he's got more sense than many  his patience's long but soon he won't have any  to find a job is like a haystack needle  'cause where he lives they don't use colored people  living just enough  just enough for the city    living just enough for the city    his hair is long  his feet are hard and gritty  he spends his life walking the streets of new york city  he's almost dead from breathing in air pollution  he tried to vote but to him there's no solution

school goodbye  and she reaches out 'n' takes my hand  and squeezes it 'n' says "how ya feelin'  hon'  and i look across at smilin' lips  that warm my heart and see my mornin' sun    and if that's not lovin' me  then all i've got to say  god didn't make little green apples  and it don't rain in indianapolis in the summertime  and there's no such thing as doctor seuss  or disneyland  and mother goose  no nursery rhyme  god didn't make little green apples  and it don't rain in indianapolis in the summertime  and when my self is feelin' low  i think about her face aglow and ease my mind    sometimes i call her up at home knowin' she's busy  and ask her if she could get away and meet me  and maybe we could grab a bite to eat  and she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me  and i'm always late  but she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me  'cause she's made that way    and if that ain't lovin' me  then all i've got to say  god didn't make little green apples  and it don't snow in minneapolis when the winter comes  and there's no such thing as make-believe  puppy dogs  autumn leaves 'n' bb guns    god didn't make little green apples  and it don't rain in indianapolis do do do do  do do do do do  do do do do do do  hey    when my dad thought i had become of age  he said  "son  you're getting to the lovin' stage"    i said  "oh yeah  oh

make in life  may take us far  chances that we take tonight  may lead us into darken places  but at the end of godly choices  are higher dreams  but in the game of chance  there's only a guilty wave or stream  sometimes i don't know which road i should take  sometimes i don't know which move i should make  but it's only if god says yes  i'll make my move  and it's only if god says yes  then i will choose  for it's only if god would just  bow his head  then i will do it  that's what i will do  i started down the right road  only to end up wrong  the endless journey carried me so far away  from my home and family  but i'm learning i was never meant to go alone  neither was it meant for me to go on my own no  sometimes i don't know which road i should take  sometimes i don't know which move i should make  i'll never go on my own  i'll never go all alone  sometimes i don't know which road i should take  sometimes i don't know which move i should make  but it's only if god says yes  i'll make my move  for it's only if god says yes  then i will choose  for it's only if god would just answer me  and it's only if god would just hear my plead  and it's only if god would just bow his head  then i will do it  that's what i will do  that's what i will do       i've got  got the victory  i've got the sweet  sweet victory in jesus  yes i do  he is a mighty conqueror  in him i will trust all my battles he'll fight  i've got  got the victory  i've got the sweet  sweet victory in jesus  for me he died but he rose on the third day  that's why i have true victory every day    truly i've been through the storm and rain  i know everything about heartache and pain  but god carried me through it all  without his protection i would surely fall  i've been broke  without a dime to my name  but all my bills got paid  because i called on jesus' name  you can't tell me that god isn't real  'cause i've got the victory  and that's why i'm still here        i'm not worried about material things i don't have  i'm just blessed 'cause i know that my savior's there  because i know that my blessing is on the way  i can't see it right now but i stand by faith  i've fought many  many battles in his name  i've held up the blood-stained banner  and proclaimed that jesus is the truth and the light  believe me when i say he will make it right        yeah  i got the victory  yeah
