through endless days  on heaven's bright shore  just singing his praise through endless days  on heaven's bright shore     in the spring of 1856  with the snow still on the ground  two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town  the father went out hunting  the boys had stayed behind  while mother tended to her chores  they wandered from her side    the two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead  by dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread  two hundred men had gathered there to comb the mountainside  the fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light      oh mommy and daddy  why can't you hear our cries?  the day is almost over  soon it will be night  we're so cold and hungry  and our feet are tired and sore  we promise not to stray again from our cabin door    now jacob diverd woke one night from a strange and eerie dream  he saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream  he told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log  for two more nights the dream returned this vision sent from god        a thousand men had searched in vain the west side of pop's creek  but jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east  with a guide to take him there jacob came upon the scene  and found the boys cold and still beneath the old birch tree    oh mommy and daddy  look past the tears you cry  we're both up in heaven now  god is by our side  as you lay us down to rest in the presence of the lord  know that we will meet you here at heaven's door    oh mommy and daddy  look past the tears you cry  we're both up in heaven now  god is by our side  and as you lay us down to rest in the presence of the lord  know that we will meet you here at heaven's door she put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette  she broke his heart  he spent his whole life tryin' to forget  we watched him drink his pain away a little at a time  but he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind  until the night    he put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger  and finally drank away her memory  life is short  but this time it was bigger  than the strength he had to get up off his knees  we found him with his face down in the pillow  with a note that said  'i'll love her till i die.'  and when we buried him beneath the willow  the angels sang a whiskey lullaby    the rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself  for years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath  she finally drank her pain away a little at a time  but she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind  until the night    she put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger  and finally drank away his memory  life is short  but this time it was bigger  than the strength she had to get up off her knees  we found her with her face down in the pillow  clinging to his picture for dear life  we laid her next to him beneath the willow  while the angels sang a whiskey lullabybaby i wanna tell you all my hopes and dreams and fears  but i'm watching television  could you get me another beer  there's wrestling and pro football on  i hope you understand  i must

been since seventeen a shipwreck balladeer  tragedy and misery are what makes my career  watery graves are my stock and trade  but it's getting harder  for all the boats that now do float are returning safely to the harbour  there hasn't been a shipwreck scene since 1965  and i find i cry each time a crew returns alive  i only cheer when gales appear and threaten fresh disaster  they pass by  the boat survives  only my career's in tatters  they're building ships too good today  and i'm the one who suffers  they don't get rent from aft to stern and their halls never rupture  not dashed on rocks and never tossed to heaven on a wave  you may think it well and good but my livelihood sails away  there once were found  twenty in town  who wrote about shipwrecks  when boats sank lots  just like rocks  'twas good as it gets  but the golden ages passed away and i'm barely survivin'  the balladeers are dead i fear and workin' in advertisin'  they're building ships too good today and it's hurtin' me  why can't even one poor soul fall into the dark sea  and be ripped apart by hungry sharks in a bloody spree  you may think it well and good  but my livelihood sails away  oh the only tragedy left to sing about is me  that government bastard's been sent to take my job from me  that inspector's making sure the ships are seaworthy  he can try  no way will i ever give up hope  when he went by  i did pry a big hole in his boat  they're building ships too good today  so i helped one along  how sweet it is to once again hear the tortured song  of a man afloat a sinking boat  who knows he will die today  you might think it bad not good  but my livelihood's here to stay  it's here to staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay when i joined a band i thought my life was pretty cool  we'd stay in hotels with room service and pools  sign body parts for fans  check into rehab and smash up the van  but looking back i should have stayed in school.    life out on the road can be dangerous you see  to rock

island ferry!one summer evening drunk as hell  i sat there nearly lifeless.  an old man in the corner sang   where the water lilies grow.  on the jukebox johnny sang   about a thing called love.  and it's "how are you kid? what's your name?  and what do you know?"    in blood and death 'neath a screaming sky  i lay down on the ground.  the arms and legs of other men  were scattered all around.  some prayed and cursed  then cursed and prayed  and then they prayed some more.  and the only thing that i could see   was a pair of brown eyes they were looking at me.  when we got back  labeled parts one to three   there was no fairer brown eyes waiting for me.    and a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' i'll go   a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' i'll go   and a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' i'll go   for a pair of brown eyes   for a pair of brown eyes.    i looked at him he looked at me   all i could do was hate him.  while ray and philomena sang   of my elusive dream.  i saw the streams and the rolling hills   where his brown eyes were waiting.  and i thought about a pair of brown eyes   that waited once for me   that waited once for me.    so drunk as hell i left the place   sometimes walking  sometimes crawling.  a hungry sound came through the breeze   so i gave the walls a talking.  and i heard the sounds of long ago   from the old canal.  and the birds were whistling in the trees   where the wind was gently laughing.    and a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' i'll go   a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' i'll go   and a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' i'll go   for a pair of brown eyes   for a pair of brown eyes. and they went home on an easter road  on a silent night tryin' not to show  who goes where and who goes when  thinkin' some day soon they'll get it back again    from the ghetto in capetown to dig the gold  little boy blue can't be sold  under tin roof and a plastic wall  thinkin' someday soon we're goin' to leave it all    and the renegades sing all the renegade songs  and the ones who know hope they're doin' wrong  the blacks and the coloreds play the biko drum  listen to the biko drum    transvaal kids on a transvaal day  little by little the show the way  to a city of dreams and solid ground  thinkin' someday soon we're gonna come around    steve he's livin' in a prison cell  all the friends that know hope he's doin' well  down here they listen to the biko drum  down here they listen to the songs he sung    and the renegades sing all the renegade songs  and the ones who know hope they're doin' wrong  the blacks and the coloreds play the biko drum  listen to

like ivory and her teeth shone like  pearls  the fellas all chased her in vain til one day  she went and got married to barney o'shea    they'd been married a year  when to their pride and joy  along came a baby  a fine strapping boy  when three years had past  they'd two boys and a girl  how to feed them and clothe them made bridget's head  whirl    bridget went to the priest  she was near desperation  because of this process of constant gestation  o father  this business is making me i'll  would it be a sin if i took to the pill?    the priest heard her story and when he had heard it  to higher authorities  perplexed  he referred it  the bishops were baffled  the cardinals too  not one could tell bridget just what she should do    two years they debated with holy profundity  what should be done about bridget's fecundity  for now bridget's children amounted to five  and she scarcely was able to keep them alive    they gave due attention to points theological  points philosophic and physiological  til in desperation  the pope cried  o sod  there's just one thing to do  i'd best go and ask god    so the pope sent a letter by five penny post  on papal notepaper  addressed  holy ghost  come send me an answer in double quick time    you can reach me at home  just ring vat 69    the pope got his answer and then he announced it  oral contraception  he thoroughly denounced it  all chemical means to prevent procreation  are banned on the pain or eternal damnation    if we were to allow it  unashamed fornication  would spread like a flash to all parts of the nation  there'd be plagues  fire  and famine and moral  pollution  atheistical notions and red revolution    and the lord knows what women would do with their lives  if they weren't kept so busy as mothers and wives  they might get ideas not befitting their station  and wind up in women's or gay liberation    so bridget  my dear  there's no need for frustration  because of the banning of this medication  the church  she is merciful  holy  and gracious  surely the old rhythm method you'll find efficacious    away now  said bridget  i'll have none of your row  for i tried it before and just look at me now  whatever i did  we continued to breed  and she's off to the chemists with maximum speed    now the church is in ferment  in great trepidation  lest such thought should spread to the whole  congregation  and they've issued a record to prevent a schism  by the pope and the hierarchy  called  i've got rhythm they dropped the bomb in '45 to end the world war  no-one had ever seen such a terrible[ sight before  the world looked on with eyes wide to see where it  might lead  the politics of power  they passed around their seed  it was a time to remember  we never can forget  they were playin' hiroshima  nagasaki  russian  roulette    they arose like the saviours of our modern human race  with radiation haloes  that hung about their face  with the key to the sure-cure  the treatment of our  ills  a hot-shot of cobalt  and a pocket-full of pills  speaking always of the enemy  who lurked across the  sea  while they crept in among us like a carrier disease    deep down inside the bunkers of the concrete and the  lead  einstein's disciples working steadily ahead  making heavy metal power-plants to fire the city  lights  all you can hear in the underground is the humming  through the night  and the walls of tight security  circle all around  where they spill out their poison and bury it in the  ground    holed up in the harbours hidden secretly away    war-heads and submarines await to make their play  the military masterminds improve on their design  the soldiers get all doped up and stumble through the  lines  while the spills into the rivers get carried out by the  tide  they call this security but we're not satisfied    our statesmen and leaders and politicians pay  quick to heed the hand that feeds  they're careful what  they say  they call out experts to assure us  to wave their magic  wands  this is the power of the future  and the future marches  on  and they call in their favours  all their political  gains  while the spills fill the rivers and settle in the  plains    i know the minds behind them  they are riddled full of  holes  not to be trusted with their hands at the controls  their eyesight it is twisted by the glory of their  careers  the heaped praise and flattery is music to their ears  to listen to them talk about how it hasn't happened  yet's  like playing hiroshima  nagasaki  russian roulette this is the day the fisherman likes  and so do i  when the rain puts a shine on the chestnut spikes  hear the curlews cry  the nightingale sings her best  we'll drink a pint in hamiltons rest  and the girl i love wore a muslin dress  the fisherman dream of the sun in the west  and so do i  and so do i  now i can see  since the girl i love dearly  has cast her loving spell on me  thiis is the day the cuckoo likes  and so do i  when the hills fall down in different shapes  and the swallows fly  to a hidden beach where boats can't go  mountain rivers overflow  i hear the squelin' of the seagulls  as off home they go  and so do i  and so do i  now i can see  since the girl i love dearly  has cast her loving spell on me  i'll cross the seven oceans  forever more i'll wander  till she has cast her loving spell on me  this is the day the fisherman likes  and so do i  when the rain puts a shine on the chestnut spikes  hear the curlews cry  the nightingale sings her best  we'll drink a pint in hamiltons rest  and the

love as the day it draws near   when sweethearts and darlings  husbands and wives   pledge love and devotion for the rest of their lives.  as day turns to evening soon nighttime does fall   young people preparing for the valentine's ball   as the night rings with laughter some people still  mourn  the 48 children who never came home.    chorus    have we forgotten the suffering and pain  the survivors and victims of the fire in artane   the mothers and fathers forever to mourn  the 48 children who never came home.    down to the stardust they all made their way  the bouncers stood back as they lined up to pay  the records are spinning there's dancing as well  just how the fire started sure no one can tell.  in a matter of seconds confusion did reign  the room was in darkness fire exits were chained  the firefighters wept for they could not hide     their anger and sorrow for those left inside.    chorus    all around the city the bad news it spread  there's a fire in the stardust there's 48 dead  hundreds of children are injured and maimed  and all just because the fire exits were chained.  our leaders were shocked  grim statements were made  they she'd tears in the graveyard as the bodies were  laid  the victims have waited in vain for 4 years  it seems like our leaders she'd crocodile tears.    chorus    half a million was spent on solicitor's fees   a fortune to the owner and his family  it's hard to believe not one penny came  to the working class people who suffered the pain.  days turn to weeks and weeks turn to years  our laws favour the rich or so it appears  a woman still waits for her lads to come home  injustice breeds anger and that's what's been done.    chorus and there was an old woman and she lived in the woods  a weila weila waila  there was an old woman and she lived in the woods  down by the river saile    she had a baby three months old  a weila weila waila  she had a baby three months old  down by the river saile    she had a penknife long and sharp  a weila weila waila  she had a penknife long and sharp  down by the river saile    she stuck the penknife in the baby's heart  a weila weila waila  she stuck the penknife in the baby's heart  down by the river saile    three loud knocks came knocking on the door  a weila weila waila  three loud knocks came knocking on the door  down by the river saile    "are you the woman who killed the child?"  a weila weila waila  "are you the woman who killed the child?"  down by the river saile    "yes i'm the woman  yes i'm the woman  yes i'm the woman who killed the child"  a weila weila waila  "yes i'm the woman who killed the child"  down by the river saile    they took her away and they hung her by the neck  a weila weila waila  they took her away and they hung her by the neck  down by the river saile    and that was the end of the woman in the woods  a weila weila waila  that was the end of the woman in the woods  down by the river sailein the cool of the evening  they used to gather.  neath the stars in the meadow circling an old oak tree.  at the times appointed... by the seasons...  of the earth and the phases of the moon.  in the center stood a woman   equal with the others and respected for her worth.  one of the many we call the witches   the healers and the teachers of the wisdom of the earth.  and the people grew through the knowledge she gave them   herbs to heal their bodies  spells to make their spirits whole.  can't ya hear them chanting healing incantations   calling forth the wise ones  celebrating in dance and song...   ... isis  astarte  diana  hecate  demeter  kali... inanna...   there were those who came to power through domination.  and they bonded in the worship of a dead man on a cross.  they sought control of the common people  by demanding allegiance to the church of rome.  and the pope declared an inquisition  it was war against the women  whose powers they feared.  in this holocaust against the nature people  nine million european women died.  and the tale is told of those who by the hundreds   holding together  chose their death in the sea.  while chanting the praises of the mother goddess   a refusal of betrayal  women were dying to be free.   ... isis  astarte  diana  hecate  demeter  kali... inanna...   now the earth is a witch and the men still burn her   stripping her down with mining and the poisons of their wars.  still to us the earth is a healer  a teacher  a mother.  a weaver of a web of light that keeps us all alive.  she gives us the vision to see through the chaos.  she gives us the courage  it is our will to survive. i was 18 when i came to town  they called it the summer of love  burning babies  burning flags  the hawks against the doves    i took a job at the steaming way  down on caltrim st  fell in love with a laundry girl  that was workin' next to me    brown hair zig zagged across her face  and a look of half surprise  like a fox caught in the headlights  there was animal in her eyes    she said to me  "can't you see i'm not the factory kind?  if you don't take me out of here  i'll surely lose my mind"    she was a rare thing  fine as a bee's wing  so fine  a breath of wind might blow her away  she was a lost child  she was runnin' wild   she said   "so long as there's no price on love  i'll stay  you wouldn't want me any other way"    we busked around the market towns  fruit pickin' down in kent  we could tinker pots and pans  or knives  wherever we went    we were campin' down the gower one time  the work was mighty good  she wouldn't wait for the harvest  i thought we should    i said to her we'll settle down  get a few acres dug  a fire burning in the hearth  and babies on the rug    she said  "oh man  you foolish man  that surely sounds like hell  you might be lord of half the world  you'll not own me as well"    she was a rare thing  fine as a bee's wing  so fine  a breath of wind might blow her away  she was a lost child  she was runnin' wild   she said   "so long as there's no price on love  i'll stay  you wouldn't want me any other way"    we were drinking more in those days  our tempers reached a pitch  like a fool i let

married once  to a man called romany brown  even a gypsy caravan  was too much like settlin' down    they say her rose has faded  rough weather and hard booze  maybe that's the price you pay  for the chains that you refuse    she was a rare thing  fine as a bee's wing  i miss her more than ever  words can say  if i could just taste all of her wildness now  if i could hold her in my arms today  i wouldn't want her any other way take a look around you how much longer can you live  this way  trash on the floor from weeks before just gets deeper  by the day  cant let go of that foolish pride you

of some sailors curse on the bridge  where it opens to let the boats through  but the natives all laugh at grandpas old stories  and swear that it just isn't true  now most of them sail across to miami  from the edge of the blue water line  with craw fish and snappers to sell at the market  for money to spend on some wine  they always cross through at the seven mile bridge  except when the moon comes out full  they're not superstitious they tell you as they are  repeating that old seaman's rule  watch out for those outlaws and pirates  lord knows that they'll steal you blind  don't mess around with those cutthroats and thieves  they're robbers and killers of time  and there's nothing worse than an old sailors curse  on the seven mile bridge where you find  they're stealing the future and making believe  the past is still somewhere behind  the seven mile bridge  the seven mile bridge  and he found a woman who'd come here from cuba  she gave him a son and a dream  they lived in a conch house somewhere on stock island  with the seven mile bridge in between  she'd spent her nights on the window walk wondering  if he'd safely pull through the storm  while he spent his money on painted up women  and whiskey to keep his blood warm  then he'd gamble on crab races till he was broke  while she sat up waiting all night  then felling too guilty to face her and tell her  he'd look for some bully to fight  at the end of the rainbow where the sun always shines  just south of the seven mile bridge  she waits at the window for signs of his sailboat  and tries not to worried the kids  she sneaks a few drinks from the bottle she hides  from a husband that's to tired to think  with feelings of guilt she picks up the bottle  and pours the remains in the sink  now she thinks of the men that stare at her boldly  they know she's a woman alone  with fingers that tremble she touches her body  and wishes her man would come home  now the years pass so quickly for time is a thief  his skin looks like leather by now  his woman's got fat and lost all he  but  lord  she's lived up to her vow  she looks at her son that's going on twenty  he's ready to live his own life  she hopes he can find a sea worthy woman  a sailor sure needs a good wife  why he's just like his daddy  she thinks as she watches  him weaving those fish nets all day  knowing that some time the seven mile bridge  will take him and lead him astray  he might return his woman would learn  broke like his daddy and drunk  she wrote down some words on an old piece of sail cloth  nailed it over his bunk  why then  she packed his sea bag and filled up his trunk  his new wife would want it that way  just before the old man shook the younger lads hand  these are the words he did say   take time to know her  take time to know her    i found a woman  one i knew i truly love  she was everything  i'd ever been dreaming of  and she was bad  i didn't know it  her pretty smile never did show it  all i knew is what i could see  and i knew i wanted her for me    i took her home to mama  mama wanted to see my future bride  she looked at us both  then she called me to her side    she said  "take time to know her  it's not an overnight thing  take time to know her  son don't rush into this thing"    but i didn't listen to my mama  i went straight down to the church  i just couldn't wait to have that little girl of mine  i couldn't even wait till i got home from work  the preacher was there  so was my future bride  he looked at us both and then he called me to his side    he said  "son take time to know her  it's not an overnight thing  take time to know her  please don't rush into this thing"    but it looked like every thing  it looked like everything was gonna be all right  then i came home from work a little early one night  when i walked in the house  i saw her there  she was kissin' on another man and i knew right then  i knew right then what my mama meant  when she took me by the hand    she said  "son take time to know her  boy it's not an overnight thing  take time to know her  there's no reason for you to rush into this thing"    take time to know her  it's not  love is not an easy thing  take time to know her  boy please don't rush into this thing  take time to know her well it was all that i could do to keep from cryin'  sometimes it seemed so useless to remain  but you don't have to call me darlin' darlin'  you never even call me by my name  you don't have to call me waylon jennings  and you don't have to call me charley pride  and you don't have to call me merle haggard anymore  even though you're on my figtin' side  and i'll hang around as long as you will let me and i never minded standing inthe rain  but you don't have to call me darlin' darlin' you never even call me by myname    well i've heard my name a few times in your phonebook  hello hello   and i've seen it on signs where i've played  but the only time i know i'll hear david allan coe  is when jesus has his final judgement day  so i'll hang around...     well a friend of mine named steve goodman wrote that song  and he told me it was the perfect country and western song  i wrote him back a letter and told him  it was not the percfect country and western song  because he hadn't said anything at all about mama  or trains or trucks or prison or gettin' drunk  well he sat down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent it to me  and after reading it i realized  that my friend had written the perfect country and western song  and i felt obliged to include it on this album the last verse goes like thishere     well i was drunk the day my mom got out of prison  and i went to pick her up in the rain  but before i could get to the station in a pickup truck  she got run'd over by a damned old train  and i'll hang around... well i've hiked through the sage brush i ran up some rail  i slept on the bench in a few county jails  and they laugh as they knocked all the wind from my sail  when i was a young dallas cowboy  i've tried hard to tackle the problems at hand  i've kicked a few habits and i've marched to the band  i tried hard to follow the lady of the land  when i was a young dallas cowboy  i've made a few passes that weren't incomplete  i stumbled through yards on my way to the street  running from beds where i did more than sleep  when i was a young dallas cowboy    well he tackled the bottle and he fumbled the ball  and he'd touchdown in alleys along where he'd fall  just wait for his son to make up for it all  when i was a young dallas cowboy  when i was a baby he broke up the team  divorcing my mama to live with a dream  he had back in college when he was still green  and i was a young dallas cowboy    now the footballs i held did not fit in my hand  got me a guitar and i've got me a band  so don't put me down when i'm taking my stand  be proud of this young dallas cowboy  yeah i'm proud i'm a young dallas cowboy  be proud of those young dallas cowboys used to go with my grandpa up to the town square  set him down up there on a picnic bench  and he used to play checkers with them other old menup there  they used to tell stories bout when they were kids  grandpa says he shot the chief of police when he was nine years old  i believe it  cause they tell me harlan knetucky was the baddest place in the world  why they say they used to sit out there on their front porch  shoot them revenuers when they'd come down the hollow  said they was so young took two of them boys  to hold the rifle and one to pull the trigger  well grandpa he'd lie a little bit  but i'll tell you there's a lot of stories in harlan county    yeah folks in harlan county lord they knew that we were poor  they always called my daddy preacher dan  but daddy weren't no preacher least ways i don't recallect  never hear of papa talk of nothin' but the land  daddy was a god fearin' farmer yes he was  could not read nor write lord he could barely sign his name  daddy was a god fearin' farmer all his life someday when i'm grown i'll be thesame    well he always grew tobacco though he did not smoke himself  he had the best tobacco crop around  and he never touched a drop of liquor that i can recall  papa made his livin' on the ground  yes sunday go to meetin' called for more than he could stand  i guess he felt at home in his old clothes  but he never missed a sunday takin' mama to the church  maybe it was habit lord but heaven only knows  daddy was a god fearin' farmer...  [ steel - fiddle ]  yeah folks in harlan county lord....  someday when i'm grown i'll be the same someday when i'm grown i'll be thesame i'd sing the red river valley  and he'd sit in the kitchen and cry  run his fingers through seventy years of livin'  wonder lord has every well i drilled ran dry  we were friends me and that old man  like desperados waiting for the train  like desperados waiting for the train    he's a drifter and a driller of oil wells  and an old school man of the world  taught me how to drive his car when he's too drunk to  and he'd wink and give me money for the girls  and our lives was like some old western movie  like desperados waiting for the train like desperados waiting for the train    from the time that i could walk he take me with him  to a place called the green frog cafe  there was old men with beer guts and dominos  lyin' bout their lives while they'd play  and i was just a kid that they all called his sidekick  like desperados waiting for the train  like desperados waiting for the train    now i looked up and he was pushin' eighty  and there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin  to me he's one of the heroes of this country  so why's he all dressed up like some old men  drinking beer and playing moon and 42  like desperados waiting for the train  like desperados waiting for the train    then just before he died i went to see him  i was grown and he was almost gone  we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen  and sang another verse to that old song   don't cry jack it's only jesus comin'   like desperados waiting for the train  like desperados waiting for the train  like desperados waiting for the train   when i was a little boy  daddy used to say to me son  we got a lotta land  and a lotta hard work to be done    go

covered with grease from his head to his feet  cussin' the sweat and the texas heat and mosquiters  and the neighbors said we lived like hicks  but they brung their cars for pa to fix anyhow  he was veteran-proud tried and true  he'd fought till his heart was black and blue  didn't know how he'd made it through the hard times  he bought our house on the gi bill  but it wasn't worth all he had to kill to git it  he drank pearl in a can and jack daniels black  chewed tobacco from a mail pouch sack  had an old dog that was trained to attack sometimes  he'd get drunk and mean as a rattlesnake  and there wasn't too much that he would take from a stranger  there were thirteen kids and a bunch of dogs  a house full of chickens and a yard full of hogs  i spent the summertime cuttin' up logs for the winter  tryin' like the devil to find the lord  workin' like a nigger for my room and board  coal-burin' stove no natural gas if that ain't country i'll kiss your ass  if that ain't country it'll

'round  the courthouse square back home in town  talking bout the big war back in 1943  sayin' how much good it's done    medals gleamin' in the sun  cussin' at my long hair  and my talk of bein' free  their vision like their battle scars    of other wars has faded  like the colors on the ribbons  from the battles that they've won  if there's one thing i've learned it's this    you just can't shake hands with a fist  and i once did my talkin' with a gun  and  old man  i know what you've seen  but yours is not the only dream    i have to believe in something more  than yesterday  let it die  just like the past  i believe there's hope at last    old man  did you ever have to pray  old man  can you show me the way    he shakes his head from time to time  and rambles somewhere in his mind  mumbling 'bout the civil war  and how we should have won    settin' up his battle plans  on checkerboards at his command  watchin' all his gallant kings  go falling one by one    and son he'd say there's not much time  for you to straighten out your mind  but you never listen to  the things i try to say    and i just turn my head and cry  never understanding why  he's set up that checkerboard  when he knew i couldn't play i can feel your arms around me like it was yesterday  i can feel your breathing next to me and hear your laughter gay  you tried to tell me what was right and i told you what was real  all i ever live for now is this piece of wood and steel    in a world that's full of trouble a world that's full of pain  lord many fall beside the road and they never rise again  many more are bending low or broken at the wheel  all i need to carry on is this piece of wood and steel    i was born my mother's only son she loves me all she can  but there isn't much to say to her since i became a man  and i often met the devil but i never made a deal  i just thank the lord for hands to play this piece of wood and steel    it's face is scarred and beaten like the ragged clothes i wear  like the body that god gave me i might give it better care  but i play it for the ladies and i play it for a meal  i play the strings just to hear 'em ring of this piece of wood and steel    i'm growing tired of searching now there's nothing much i crave  give or take a little time and you can write it on my grave  there's nothing more i care to own nothing left to feel  all i ever wanted was this piece of wood and steel    i can feel your arms around me like it was yesterday  i can feel your breathing next to me and hear your laughter gay  you tried to tell me what was right and i told you what was real  all i ever live for now is this piece of wood and steel  in a world that's full of trouble a world that's full of pain  lord many fall beside the road and they never rise again

i reached twenty-one  and i thought i was a pretty big wheel  i left the country for the city  met a slicker with a shady deal    he said  "hold up the bank  boy and take all the money  and run as fast as you can  the only way you'll ever get along in this world  is to get a little dirt on your hands  get a little dirt on your hands    get a little dirt on your hands  son  get a little dirt on your hands  if you want to grow up to be a big  big man  get a little dirt on your hands  get a little dirt on your hands"    well  it's four in the morning  and the warden is calling' my name  he said he's teaching' me a lesson  now he's making' me go work in the rain    dig that ditch  boy  fill it up  i'm wanting you to understand  the only way to straighten out a guy like you  is to get a little dirt on his hands  get a little dirt on his hands    hey  david got to get a little dirt on those hands boy  yeah  if you want to grow up to be a big  big man  you better remember what old

and a cork poppin' from a bottle  i tell you son the old man said  it was hell in world war two  as he rolled up his pant leg  i saw the wood that filled his shoe  the younger man who followed him in opened up his vest  showed the older soldier where he caught one in the chest  both of them had purple hearts for the hell that they've been through  well i don't have no purple heart mine's just black and blue  chorus:  oh love is a never ending war  march me into action  and we'll train for what's in store  you win some and you lose some  but i believe in what i'm fightin' for  oh love is a never ending war  they where half-way through that bottle  and they where gettin' high  i never fought in those two wars  but lord my throat was dry  so i showed them scars and stitches  inflicted by maria  but i didn't think that would give me a drink  so i blamed it on korea  i parted my hair and i showed them where  i got shrapnel from a grenade  i just couldn't tell it was where annabelle  put a glas of lemonade  how that i've been tortured by the blade of a bajonet  and i never forget that hot august night  and the fingernails of jeanet  chorus  as i neared my destination i saw tears well

jones was full of whiskey and he couldn't singanymore. they said he was skinny and sickly looking and he was through. i told'em he was one of my best friends and whiskey could never make gorge jonesquit singing. george was on the wagon when we done this song but he sings likehe wishes he had a drink.    last week he spent his whole pay check on whiskey    i know friday night he'll do it all again    oh he'll drink till he falls down    then he'll order one more round    and then go home with that bottle in his hand    and the only thing i can hold on to    is this bottle in my hand    i know i'll never have to share it    with any other man    i'm so glad you introduced us    and i'll do the best i can    to be faithful to this bottle in my hand    she told george that changing diapers    could sure become a drag    and to clean the house and cook for him    was not her kind of bag    she said she needed someone    who would love and understand    then she left him with that bottle in his hand    and the only thing i can hold on to    is this bottle in my hand    i know i'll never have to share it    with any other man    i'm so glad you introduced us    and i'll do the best i cani want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widow wife  who had a teenage daughter that attended harper valley junior high  well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play  and she said  "mama  i've got a note here from the harper valley pta"  well the note says "mrs. johnson  you're wearing your dresses way too high  it's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin'wild  now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way"  and it was signed by the secretary  harper valley pta    well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon  and boy  were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room  and as she walked up to the blackboard i can still recall the word she had tosay  she said "i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta    now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for adate  and mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away  and mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town  and shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulledcompletely down    now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's baragain  and if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nipof gin  and then you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that i ain't fit  well this is just a little payton place and you're all harper valleyhypocrites    now i wouldn't put you on because it really did  it happened just this way  that day my mama socked it to the harper valley pta  that day my mama socked it to 'em at the harper valley pta  dolly parton   my train of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter  something badly needed to brighten up the chores  seemed old mrs. bailey had accidentally fell  in the water being used to scrub the floors  now mrs. bailey was the meanest matron at the home  she believed in lots of work with little play  and we laughed till we bent double  though we knew we'd get in trouble  but trouble's all we had at evening shade  now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding  to teach you love and keep you off the streets  and all the kids that live here are said to be a problem  juvenile delinquents so to speak  but understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger  an iron has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate  the reason we were here is 'cause we had no one who cared  but they cared even less at evening shade  little susan bradley  one night had wet her bed  mrs. bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death  and i knew that something must be done to put an end to this  and so i started talking plans with the older kids  plans were that joe johnson would steal the kerosene  and i would get some matches when nobody seen  beckie adams would make sure the kids were all outside  billy watson would look out for the evil eye  now mrs. bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day  we knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway  now that its all over and the sun is going down  there's no evening shade 'cause we burned it to the ground    joe south   oh the games people play now  every night and every day now  never meaning what they say now  never saying what they mean  oh they whine away the hours  in their ivory towers  til they're covered up with flowers  in the back of a black limousine    la la la mmm da da da  la la la mmm da da dee  i'm talkin' 'bout you and me  and the games people play    oh they make one another cry  break their hearts and they say good-bye  cross their heart and they hope to die  that the other was to blame  neither one will ever give in  so they gaze at an eight by ten  thinkin' 'bout the way it might have been  and it's a dirty rotten shame    la la la mmm da da da  la la la mmm da da dee  i'm talkin' 'bout you and me  and the games people play    oh they teach how to meditate  read your horoscope and teach you faith  the furthermore the hell with hate  come on and get on board  look around and tell me what you see  what's a-happenin' to you and to me  god grant me the serenity  to just remember who i am    la la la mmm da da da  la la la mmm da da dee  i'm talkin' 'bout you and me  and the games people play  dolly parton   we might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank  we fed ourselves from the fruit of the land  and quenched our thirst with rain  we never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet  life just had no pattern for gypsy joe and me  all we had was each other and the rags upon our back  the closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack  but we had all we needed and the rest we didn't need  life was free and simple for gypsy joe and me  now gypsy was my little dog  i found by the road in a ditch  and so i named him gypsy  cause that name just seemed to fit  oh and joe he was my man  the flower of my soul  thou he never said he loved me  i just always seemed to know  while standing by the highway  thumbin' for a ride  the speeding wheels of a passing car  took gypsy's life  i lost him where i found him and his loss was misery  now there's no more gypsy  there's just joe and me  well the winter came and the snow did fall  and the night was cold and still  and the rags we wore were not enough  and joe he caught the chill  and he told me how he loved me  and in my arms he went to sleep  now there's no more gypsy  no more joe  there's just me  while standin' here on the edge of this bridge  lookin' down i see  the face of joe and gypsy  lookin' back at me  and somewhere in the distance i can hear them callin' me  tonight we'll be together again  gypsy  joe and me   dolly parton   it's all i can do to keep from falling in love with you  all i can do to keep from letting it show  yeah it's all i can do to keep from falling in love with you  all i can do to keep from telling you so  i wasn't looking for love when i found you  just someone to be with and have a good time  but i get these strange funny feelings around you  when you're not with me  you're still on my mind  and it's all i can do to keep from falling in love with you  all i can do to keep from letting it show  yeah it's all i can do to keep from falling in love with you  all i can do to keep from telling you so  i had intended to wait for a long time  i thought that love would just mess up my plans  'cause i had big plans for a bright shining future  could this be my future that's holding my hand  and it's all i can do to keep from falling in love with you  all i can do to keep from letting it show  yeah it's all i can do to keep from falling in love with you  all i can do to keep from telling you so  i need to tell you how i feel about you  but i'm so afraid that you don't feel the same  but if i don't tell you how i feel about you  i just might lose you  can i take that chance  and it's all i can do to keep from falling in love with you  all i can do to keep from letting it show  yeah it's all i can do to keep from falling in love with you  all i can do to keep from telling

applejack picked apples but he picked the banjo too  play a song for me applejack  applejack  play a song for me and i'll sing  play a song for me applejack  applejack  play a song  let your banjo

banjo and i'd play my tambourine  play a song for me applejack  applejack  play a song for me and i'll sing  play a song for me applejack  applejack  play a song  let your banjo ring  that's when i

around  and every saturday morning daddy takes us all to town  and we'd go to the picture show  have picnics on the ground  oh  that's the lower class then i'm glad that's what i am    cause my mama don't belong to the ladies social set  my daddy can't afford the country club  his folks look down on me and they don't let us date  cause they think that i'm not good enough    but my mama says forgive him honey  he ain't worth at all  and if anything  you're too good for him  just because they've got money and a big fine house  aha  we won't take no sad talks off them    we've got chicken every sunday and the preacher comes around  and every saturday morning daddy takes us all to town  and we'd go to the picture show  have picnics on the ground  oh  that's the lower class then i'm glad that's what i am    we've got chicken every sunday and the preacher comes around  and every saturday morning daddy takes us in to town back through the years  i go wanderin' once again  back to the seasons of my youth  i recall a box of rags that someone gave us  and how my momma put the rags to use  there were rags of many colors  every piece was small  and i didn't have a coat  and it was way down in the fall  momma sewed the rags together  sewin' every piece with love  she made my coat of many colors  that i was so proud of  as she sewed  she told a story  from the bible  she had read  about a coat of many colors  joseph wore and then she said  i hope this coat will bring you  good luck and happiness  and i just couldn't wait to wear it  and momma blessed it with a kiss    my coat of many colors  that my momma made for me  made only from rags  but i wore it so proudly  although we had no money  i was rich as i could be  in my coat of many colors  my momma made for me    so with patches on my britches  and holes in both my shoes  in my coat of many colors  i hurried off to school  just to find the others laughing  and making fun of me  and my coat of many colors  my momma made for me    and oh i couldn't understand it  for i felt i was rich  and i told them of the love  my momma sewed in every stitch  and i told 'em all the story  momma told me while she sewed  and how my coat of many colors  was worth more than all their clothes    but they didn't understand it  and i tried to make them see  that one is only poor  only if they choose to be  now i know we had no money  but i was rich as i could be  in my coat of many colors  my momma made for me  made just for me  dolly parton   down on music row  down on music row  if you want to be a star  that's where you've got to go  i could feel a change a comin'  i left my hometown a hummin'  with my ol' guitar a strummin'  songs that i had wrote  i was on my way to nashville  i just couldn't hardly wait  'till i could sing my songs  to the folks on music row  i got into nashville early  sleepy  hungry  tired and dirty  and on the steps of rca  i ate a stale  sweet roll  in the fountain at the hall of fame  i washed my face and read the names  in the walkway of the stars  down on music row  down on music row  down on music row  if you want to be a star  that's where you've got to go  i waited there 'till eight o'clock  when office doors became unlocked  then i started walkin'  down the streets of music row  just a walkin' up and down the street  tryin' to find out who to see  to help me get on record  and to hear the songs i'd wrote  but i found it goin' rough  everyone was all tied up  either in a conference  or in the studio  they said that i could leave a tape  but they'd suggest i didn't wait  'cause everyone was awful busy  down on music row  but i could feel that change a comin'  and i just kept right on a hummin'  with my ol' guitar still strummin'  all them songs that i'd wrote  and then chet and bob at rca  well  they listened to my songs that day  and they both told me that i was on my way  down on music row  down on music row  down on music row  if you want to be a star  that's where you've got to go    dolly parton   dr. robert f. thomas  may his name forever stand  dr. robert f. thomas  was a mighty  mighty man  and he enriched the lives  of everyone that ever knew him  and in my song i hope to sing  some of the praise that's due him  dr. thomas was a man  the lord must have appointed  to live among us mountain folks  in eastern tennessee  and he delivered more than half  the babies in those mountains  among those babies  he delivered me  there was no way to drive along  the roads back in those mountains  but dr. thomas got there  just the same  he often rode on horseback  to get where he was needed  but if he had to walk  he always came  dr. robert f. thomas  may his name forever stand  dr. robert f. thomas  was a mighty  mighty man  and he enriched the lives  of everyone that ever knew him  and in my song i hope to sing  some of the praise that's due him  dr. thomas was a friend  a neighbor and a doctor  though he seldom got a dime  for all he'd done  and i remember lots of times  we sent for dr. thomas  but i don't recall a time  he didn't come  they say a man is judged  by the deeds he does while livin'  a judgement when he stands  before the lord  and i know heaven holds a place  for men like dr. thomas  and i know that he'll receive  his just reward  dr. robert f. thomas  may his name forever stand  dr. robert f. thomas  was a mighty  mighty man  and he enriched the lives  of everyone that ever knew him  and in my song i hope to sing  some of the praise that's due him    dolly parton   without a love to call my own my life was

dolly parton   in my mind i've made love to you often  but only in my mind can it be so  'cause there's someone at home that's countin' on me  and if i did  i'm sure that he would know  yes  he would know  yes  he could tell  for  he has loved me long enough to know me very well  and if i lied  he'd see it in my eyes  i know my guilt would show and he would know  but i must admit you're someone very special  and it would be so easy to let go  makin' love to you could be so easy  but if i did  i'm sure that he would know  yes  he would know  yes  he could tell  for  he has loved me long enough to know me very well  and if i lied  he'd see it in my eyes  i know my guilt would show and he would know  my conscience just won't let me make love to you  i know it would be sweet  but i just can't  when i go home to him i must be able  to look him in the eyes and say i ain't  'cause he would know  yes  he could tell  for  he has loved me long enough to know me very well  and if i lied  he'd see it in my eyes  i know my guilt would show and he would know  he would know    dolly parton   there's a bit of magic in a simple little smile  something that just makes life seem a little more worthwhile  and there's a world of meaning in the touch of someone's hand  a gentle touch that let's your brother know you understand  oh if people would stop taking and just once try to give  we could make the world we're living in a better place to live  la la la la la la la la la la la la  and if we'd love one another instead of finding faults  we could afford the price of peace  love is all it costs  oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony  everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me  la la la la la la la la la la la la  all life has to offer that's what most folks desire  but offer nothing in return  cause they don't seem to care  and if we'd ask to be forgiven and be willing to forgive  we could make the world we're living in a better place to live  and if we'd all climb together  we could climb the highest hill  we could make the world we're living in a better place to live  and if we'd love one another instead of finding faults  we could afford the price of peace  love is all it costs  oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony  everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me  la la la la la la la la la la la la    dolly parton   you look at me that way  i know what your eyes say  your eyes reflect love and desire  i see that you need me  i need you to please me  you touch me and set me on fire  it's the way that you love me  the way that you touch me  the way that you whisper my name  i cannot resist you  each time i kiss you  then everything goes up in flames  baby i'm burning out of control  baby i'm burning body and soul  hot as a pistol of flaming desire  baby i'm burning  you got me on fire  i'm on fire  this red hot emotion  puts fireworks in motion  it looks like the fourth of july  there's no use in fighting  the fire you've ignited  just stand back and watch the sparks fly  baby i'm burning out of control  baby i'm burning body and soul  hot as a pistol of flaming desire  baby i'm burning  you

baby i'm burning body and soul  hot as a pistol of flaming desire  baby i'm burning  you got me on fire   we're all together once again  for the first time in i don't know when  we were so close once upon a time  there were five of us kids at home  two girls  three boys and dad and mom  but that was in the better part  of life we left behind  remember that old swimming hole  where we would swim so long ago  and all them possum grapes and muskedines  and do you recall the time  we all got drunk on homemade wine  that was in the better part  of life we left behind    life was simple for us then  if only it could be again  how i wish we could go back in time  but time moves on and nothin' lasts  except the memories from the past  memories from the better part  of life we left behind    remember how we talked as kids  of what we'd be when we got big  and all the dreams that we held in our minds  i wanted to be a singin' star  and you all said that i'd go far  but that was in the better part  of life we left behind    remember all the fun we had  back when they say times were bad  and life was good to us and things were fine  we had fun and we had love  and a mom and dad to care for us  but that was is the better part  of life we left behind    life was simple for us then  if only it could be again  how i wish we could go back in time  but time moves on and nothin' lasts  except the memories from the past  memories from the better part  of life we left behind  sweet memories from the better part  of life we left behind  dolly parton   in my home town of blackie  kentucky  he came passin' through one dark  gloomy day  and i considered myself as lucky  when he told me he would take me away  and though he was older  it made me no difference  his promise of riches was all i could see  at last i could leave the coal mines of kentucky  and know something better than sad poverty  blackie  kentucky  you know that i'll miss you  but there are other places in the world i'd like to see  so i must take this chance to be somethin' more than nothin'  but i'll always hold you in my memory  but i've never adjusted to sociable livin'  the friends that he knows  they're all strangers to me  thousands of miles from blackie  kentucky  in a mansion with a husband that never loved me  he won't let my family and friends come to visit  because they are country and poor  he's ashamed  oh  but i'd give my life  lord  if i could just go see them  all that's changed about me is my name  blackie  kentucky  oh lord  how i miss you  if i could come back home  i'd never leave you anymore  i'd like to see my poor  hardworking  coal-minin' daddy  and mama  and the kids  and the friends i knew before  my world is as black as the coal in kentucky  he won't let me leave him - there's no way to win  i'll take my own life  dear god  please forgive me  but i've got to get back home to blackie once again  an' i've left him a note  in the mornin' he'll find it  it's my last request and he can't refuse me  i've told him to bury me back in blackie  kentucky  where my family and my friends can come and visit me  blackie  kentucky i'm comin' home to you  but different from the way you remember me before  so make me a place and i'll lay me down to rest  and i'll sleep in your arms forevermore  i'll sleep in your arms forever more   folks say my daddy wasn't much of a man  for disobeying the laws of the land  folks say that my daddy wasn't fit to kill  oh and i know it was true what the people said  cause we'd all've been better of dead  than to live a life of shame and strife  cause of daddy's moonshine still  my mama was always sweet and kind  but she grew old before her time  worryin' about the way we had to live  yeah my daddy put the wrinkles in my mama's face  he drunk his share of all he made  and just one more reason i grew to hate  my daddy's moonshine still  chorus:  daddy's moonshine still was good for nothin'  but to break mama's heart  and to tear our home apart  make our lives a livin' hell  them old mason jars that daddy made us wash  and set them out to sun on our back porch  'til he got ready to take 'em up on the hill  and when daddy got word of the revenue  he made us kids help hide his brew  made us swear that we never knew  about daddy's moonshine still  yeah and two of my brothers drove across the state line  once a week with a load of moonshine  and the wounds that came from that won't ever heal  cause on a moonshine run one rainy night  my two brothers lost their lives  and oh my god how i despise  my daddy's moonshine still  repeat chorus  well it broke mama's heart but she understood  the day that i left home for good  but i had to find me another way to live  well i sent mama money nearly every day  and how i made it  well i'd rather not say  but at least it took me far away  from daddy's moonshine still  my bootlegging daddy was known quite well  and he made our home a livin' hell  and i ain't forgot it and i know that i never will  my mama finally died she just gave up  and daddy finally died from drinkin' that stuff  and bad memories haunt the rest of us  from daddy's moonshine still  repeat chorus    dolly parton   i know this dress i'm wearing doesn't hide the secret i've tried concealing  when he left he promised me he'd be back by the time it was revealing  the sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow o'er the fields ofclover  and time is running out for me  i wish that he would hurry down from dover  he's been gone so long  when he left the snow was deep upon the ground  and i have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown  at any time a tiny face will show itself 'cause waiting's almost over  but i won't have a name to give it if he doesn't hurry down from dover  fromdover  from dover  my folks weren't understanding  when they found out they sent me from the homeplace  my daddy said if folks found out he'd be ashamed to ever show his face  my mamma said i was a fool  she did not believe it when i told her  momma  everything's gonna be all right 'cause soon he would be coming downfrom dover  i found a place to stay out on a farm takin' care of that old lady  she never asked me nuthin' so i never talked to her about my baby  i sent a messgae to my mom with a name and address of ms. ol' grover  and to make sure he got that information when he came down from dover  i loved him more than anything and i could not refuse him when he needed me  he was the only one i'd loved and i just can't believe that he was usin' me  he wouldn't leave me here like this  i know it can't be so  it can't be over  he wouldn't make me go through this alone  he'll be coming down from dover  my body aches the time is here it's lonely in this place where i'm lying  our baby has been born  but something's wrong  it's too still  i hear nocrying  i guess in some strange way she knew she'd never have a father's arms to holdher  so dying was her way of tellin' me he wasn't coming down from dover  fromdover  from dover  down from dover   today as i was walking  in the fields just down the way  i sat down on a fallen log  to pass the time away  and as i looked around me  the more that i did look  the more i realize that i am viewing  god's coloring book  i saw a golden ray of sunlight  a silver drop of dew  a soft  white floating cloud  sailing cross the sky 'a blue  a yellow dandelion  pretty evergreen  and some red and orange flowers  growing wild along the stream  and the more i look around me  and the more that i do look  the more i realize that i am viewing  god's coloring book  the greyness in an old man's hair  the pink in baby's cheeks  the blackness in a stormy sky  the brown in fallen leaves  and the multicolored rainbow  stretched out across the sky  and the purple haze at sunset  just before the night  and the more i look around me  and the more that i do look  the more i realize that i am viewing  god's coloring book  then i turn my face toward the sky  and say a silent prayer  though god doesn't speak to me  i see him everywhere  he is all around me  he's everywhere i look  and each new day is but a new page  in god's coloring book  tag:  each new day is but a new page  in god's coloring book  hmmmmmm   you shake my nerves and you rattle my brain  too much love can drive a girl

tahoe ski chalet  with a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood  but even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and    you've made this a christmas to remember  springtime feelin's in the middle of december  change the radio and i'll turn the lights down dimmer  oh! what a christmas to remember    strangers when we met  lovers as we leave  christmas to remember  too good to believe

the middle of december  neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender  oh! what a christmas to remember    we loved and laughed and played and joked  sang christmas songs and talked to folks

in your hands  now i don't recall you said it  but we'd lived so long on credit  and so we headed out to find our promised land  just poor appalachian farm folk  with nothing more than high hopes  we hitched our station wagon to a star  but our dreams all fell in on us  'cause there was no land of promise  and it's a stuggle keepin' sight of who you are  oh and these northern nights are dreary

and if you're quick enough to rise  you'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow  out on the new horizon  you may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings  and if the sleep has left your ears  you might hear footsteps running through an open meadow    don't be concerned  it will not harm you  it's only me pursuing something i'm not sure of  across my dreams  with nets of wonder  i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love    you might have heard my footsteps  echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind  i might have even called your name  as i ran searching after something to believe in  you might have seen me runnin'  through the long abandonned ruins of the dreams you left behind  if you remember something there  that glided past you followed close by heavy breathing    don't be concerned  it will not harm you  it's only me pursuing something i'm not sure of  across my dreams  with nets of wonder  i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love    across my dreams  with nets of wonder  i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love  across my dreams  with nets of wonder  i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love being born was the worse and the first mistake i ever made  the doctor didn't spank me  he just slapped me in the face  and the cup of love was always quenching someone else's thirst  leaving me to swallow the bitter taste of hurt  'cause i was raised an orphan  never wanted as a kid until the year i turned 13  then everybody did  strangers pass me back and forth  men just took me as they pleased  and others had a cinderella slave to cook and clean and weep    though the deck is stacked against you  win or lose  you have to play  the hand a life has dealt you  and it's a gamble either way    on a dust road at 15 in a yellow cotton dress  with the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down my neck  and the dry cracked plains would make me think of a prehistoric time  or should i fear what lay before me less than what i'd left behind  a 15 year old girl don't have no trouble hitching rides  but sometimes when you're riding free  you'll pay the highest price  on back roads and in back seats  and in a cheap highway motel  but what's a few more strangers in a life of nothing else    though the deck is stacked against you  win or lose  you have to play  the hand a life has dealt you  and it's a gamble either way    16 caught me crying  underneath the scarlet light  on the door steps of a stranger on a cold and rainy night  when i walked into the parlour here  other pieces seemed to fit  i was good at pleasing strangers  so i made the most of it    either way it's all a gamble  so view the stakes and know the odds  and lay your cards upon the table  do all the dealing from the top    though the deck is stacked against you  win or lose  you have to play  the hand a life has dealt you  and it's a gamble either way hey  maybe i'll dye my hair  maybe i'll move somewhere  maybe i'll

makes him act like such a fool  she swears she never knew but always needed to  but stubborn pride is just the way of cowboys i suppose  even love can't change the things he ought to change the most  and it's pride that keeps him standing when he should be on his knees  makin' apologies but she loves him desperately  oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet  so he'd know all the perfect lines to say  and have some great romantic way to show it  be the hero ridin' up to save the day  and go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor  to sweep her up and carry her away  oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her  no cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways  "i love you" and "i'm sorry" are words that just don't come  cause words like that are no match for the kind that rule his tongue  but his eyes keep tellin' her "you know i love you anyway  no matter what i say or what i never say"  oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet  so he'd know all those fancy lines to say  and have some great romantic way to show it  be the hero ridin' up to save the day  and go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor  and sweep her up and carry her away  oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her  no cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways  his ways seem cold but she knows he's much warmer  but even love can't change a cowboy's ways  he's just a fool that must defend his honor  but even love can't change a cowboy's ways    dolly parton   in a dream i was walkin' in a beautiful field  i was gathering flowers at the foot of a hill  when a bright light descended and it spread o'er the land  jesus stood on the mountain and he held out his hand  then he came down from the mountain  headed down to the sea  and the children strowed flowers in the path at his feet  and he was filled with compassion and the beasts from the wild  came as gentle as lambs and they all walked at his side  there's a calm on the water  a hush in the crowd  there's peace in the valley  there's a stillness about  there's a light in the darkness  there's joy in his love  ain't that a wonderful feelin'  let us lift him up  then he suddenly vanished from the crowd down below  reappeared on the mountain in a radiant glow  he said your questions are many but the answer is love  i'll draw all men unto me if i be lifted up  there's a calm on the water  a hush in the crowd  there's peace in the valley  there's a stillness about  there's a light in the darkness  there's joy in his love  there is life everlasting  let us lift him up  he said if i  be lifted up  he said if i be lifted up  what did he say  he said if i  be lifted up  he said if i be lifetd up  let's lift him higher and higher  and higher and higher each day  let's lift him up  he said if i  be lifted up  oh if i be lifted up  there's a calm on the water  a hush in the crowd  there's peace in the valley  there's a stillness about  there's a light in the darkness  and joy in his love  it's a wonderful feelin'  lift him up  he said if i  be lifted up  he said if i be lifted up  that's what he said  he said if i  be lifted up  if i be lifted up   the crops are all in and the peaches are rotting  the

it of me though i expect it of you  i love you  i do  but i can't be true  men are my weakness i've got a roving eye  and i've fallen victim to many a smile  i just love the excitement of love when it's new  i'm just a hopeless romantic so i can't be true  i can't be true  i can't be true no matter what i do  it's a weakness of mine  nothin' to do with you  so don't expect it of me though i

mountain angels sing  a bittersweet refreign of my smokey mountain home  heartsong  farmer's daughter if you will  and i often wonder still  in memories where i rammbled as a child  makes me cry and makes me laugh  my reflections on the past  and the family  friends  and faith that shaped my life  ragged clothes and hand-me-downs  just enough to go around  but the sweetest things in life are always free  like the songs the birds would sing  and the sweet new grass of spring  and the sacred blossoms on the dogwood tree  repeat chorus  and i recall the thrill and joy  of a smokey mountain boy  i remember my first kiss and my first love  and the songs i'd song and write  and the dreams i'd clutch so tight  and the loved ones that gave me that extra shove  and in that little house 'a prayer  where i spent many hour  prassin' god and liftin' up his name  and asking him to lead and to keep watch over me  as i headed up that rocky road to fame  and now this  smokey mountain girl has been all around the world  but it makes no difference just how far i roam  i still cling to that part that is so dear to my heart  my faith in god and memories of home  repeat chorus   i dreamed i was there in hillbilly heaven oh what a beautiful sight  and i met all the stars in hillbilly heaven oh what a star spangled night  last night i dreamed i went to hillbilly heaven  and just as i arrived the old curtain lifted  and there on stage stood who else but roy acuff and tex ritter  they said well how you doing come on in here  i know there's some folks you want to see  over there's our newest

place called blue valley  at the foot of the tennessee hills  with the blue birds and blue bells  and blue mountain water  and the sound of the blue whippoorwill  but there was no peace in the valley

herself in her music  the one thing she did understand    and she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet  her voice has that high  lonesome sound  she hurts  and her songs are the best way to show it  so the blue valley songbird keeps traveling around    she hopes someday she will make it  and everyone says that she will  when she comes to town  crowds flock around  to see the girl from the tennessee hills  she writes her letter back home to her mama  in care of the preacher in town  they're sacred to her so she reads them at church  and so her daddy cannot track her down    and she sings like a bird and she cries like a baby  whenever she turns off the lights  she's a whole lot lonesome and a little bit crazy  from mem'ries and miseries and dreams gone awry    blue dress  blue shoes  a blue cadillac  a band dressed in blue by her side  instruments tied to the top and the back  'cause the blue valley songbird is singing tonight    one nighters  honky tonks  years flying by

i wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world   like barbie or the models in the fredricks' catalog.  from rags to wishes in my dreams i could have it all.  i'm just a backwoods barbie  too much makeup  too much hair.  don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not all there.  don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that  i'm as shallow as i look 'cause i run true and deep.    i've always been misunderstood because of how i look.  don't judge me by the cover 'cause i'm a real good book.  so read into it what you will  but see me as i am.  the way i look is just a country girl's idea of glam.    i'm just a backwoods barbie in a push-up bra and heels.  i might look artificial  but where it counts i'm real.  and i'm all dolled up and hopin' for a chance to prove my worth   and even backwoods barbie's get their feelings hurt.    i'm just a backwoods barbie  too much makeup  too much hair.  don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not all there.  yes  i can see where i could be misjudged upon first glance   but even backwoods barbie's deserve a second chance.  i'm just a backwoods barbie just asking for a chance   just a backwoods barbie.  dolly parton   i was lookin' for greener pastures  when i left my old kentucky home  i was chasin' after dreams i thought i'd master  so i left the one that loved me all along  thinkin' only of myself and doin' better  didn't care about the grief i left behind  didn't even make a card or write a letter  so sure i'd be successful in no time  now i'm heading for bluer pastures  and back to the one who's heart i broke  to the bluegrass state of kentucky  where he waits with open for me i hope  ain't it funny how you are when you're younger?  how what you have is never good enough  how the years will find you searchin' through your plunder  lookin' for the treasures you gave up  well the seasons came  they went  the dreams all shattered  while the grass just stayed a lonely shade of brown  then i realized i'd lost all that had mattered  so with foolish pride aside  i'm homeward bound  now i'm heading for bluer pastures  and back to the one who's heart i broke  to the bluegrass state of ole kentucky  where he waits with open for me i hope  now i'm heading for bluer pastures  where the bluegrass waves sweetly in the wind  where the bluegrass music's always playin'  to the haunting sound of monroe's mandolin  i'm heading for bluer pastures    feat. judy collins and rhonda vincent     rows and floes of angel hair  and ice cream castles in the air  and feather canyons ev'rywhere  i've looked at clouds that way    but now they only block the sun  they rain and snow on ev'ryone  so many things i would have done  but clouds got in my way  i've looked at clouds from both sides now  from up and down  and still somehow  it's cloud illusions i recall  i really don't know clouds at all    moons and junes and ferris wheels  the dizzy dancing way you feel  as ev'ry fairy tale comes real  i've looked at love that way    but now it's just another show  you leave 'em laughing when you go  and if you care  don't let them know  don't give yourself away    i've looked at love from both sides now  from give and take  and still somehow  it's love's illusions i recall  i really don't know love at all    tears and fears and feeling proud  to say "i love you" right out loud  dreams and schemes and circus crowds  i've looked at life that way    but now old friends are acting strange  they shake their heads  they say i've changed  well something's lost  but something's gained  in living ev'ry day    i've looked at life from both sides now  from win and lose and still somehow  it's life's illusions i recall  i really don't know life at all  i've looked at life from both sides now  from up and down  and still somehow  it's life's illusions i recall  i really don't know life at all when the mornin' sun  streaks across my room  and i'm wakin' up  from another dream of you  yes  you know i'm on the road  once again it seems  all that's left behind  is a chain of broken dreams    but you know that i love you  you know that i love you  oh  i love you    and how i wish that love  was all we'd need to live  what a life we'd have  'cause i've got so much to give  but ya' know i feel so sad  down inside my heart  that the dollar sign  should be keepin' us apart    but you know that i love you  you know that i love you  oh  how i love you    and if only i could find my way back to the time  when the problems of this life  had not yet crossed my mind  and the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes  i'd come runnin' back to you  i'd come runnin' back to you    but you know we can't  live on dreams alone  got to pay the rent  so i must leave you all alone  'cause you know i made my choice many years ago  and now this travelin' life  well  it's the only life i know    but you know that i love you  you know that i love you  oh  i love you  but you

half in hope of sorrow  and half in fear the day  would find the soldiers breakin' through  to drag us all away  and just before the sunrise  i heard something at the wall  the gate began to rattle  and a voice began to call  i hurried to the window  looked down into the street  expecting swords and torches  and the sound of soldiers' feet    but there was no one there but mary  so i went down to let her in  john stood there beside me  as she told me where she'd been  she said they've moved him in the night  and none of us know where  the stone's been rolled away  and now his body isn't there    we both ran towards the garden  then john ran on ahead  we found the stone and empty tomb  just the way that mary said  but the winding sheet they wrapped him in  was just an empty shell  and how or where they'd taken him  was more than i could tell    oh something strange had happened there  just what i did not know  john believed a miracle  but i just turned to go  circumstance and speculation  couldn't lift me very high  'cause i'd seen them crucify him  then i saw him die    back inside the house again  the guilt and anguish came  everything i'd promised him  just added to my shame  when at last it came to choices  i denied i knew his name  and even if he was alive  it wouldn't be the same    but suddenly the air was filled  with a strange and sweet perfume  light that came from everywhere  drove shadows from the room  and jesus stood before me  with his arms held open wide  and i fell down on my knees  and i just clung to him and cried    then he raised me to my feet  and as i looked into his eyes  the love was shining out from him  like sunlight from the skies  guilt in my confusion  disappeared in sweet release  and every fear i ever had  just melted into peace    he's alive yes he's alive  yes he's alive and i'm forgiven  heaven's gates are open wide  he's alive yes he's alive  oh he's alive and i'm forgiven  heaven's gates are open wide  he's alive he's alive  hallelujah he's alive  he's alive and i'm forgiven  heaven's gates are open wide  he's alive he's alive he's alive  i believe it he's alive  sweet jesusi'm a brave little soldier  i must be bold and

to use    there were rags of many colours  and every piece was small  and i didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall  mamma sewed the rags together  sewing ever piece with love  she made my coat of many colours  that i was so proud of    as she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read  about a coat of many colours  joseph wore and they she said  perhaps this coat will bring you  much love and happiness  and i just couldn't wait to wear it  and mamma blessed it with a kiss    my coat of many colours that mamma made for me  made only rags  but i wore it so proudly  although we had no money. oh i was rich as i could be  in my coat of many colours  my mamma made for me    so with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes  in my coat of many colours  i hurried off to school  just to find the others laughing and makin' fun of me  in my coat of many colours  my mamma made for me    oh  i couldn't understand it  for i felt i was rich  and i told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch  and i told them all the story  mamma told me while she sewed  and how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes    they didn't under stand it and i tried to make them see  that one is only poor only if they choose to be  now i know we have no money  but i'm as rich as i could be  in my coat of many colours  my mamma made for me  in my coat of many colours  my mamma just made for me  wayne kemp   well i really had a ball last night  i held all the pretty boys tight  i was feelin' single  seein' double  wound up in a whole lotta trouble  but today i'll face the big fight  but i really had a ball last night  when i came home from work this morning  my baby was feelin' low  and he told me what was on his mind  then he told me where i could go  well i didn't go where he told me to  cause the water was cold in the lake  now there's something fishy 'bout this whole deal  i don't see where i made my mistake  well i really had a ball last night  i held all the pretty boys tight  i was feelin' single  seein' double  wound up in a whole lotta trouble  but today i'll face the big fight  but i really had a ball last night  when i woke up this morning  like me  the sun was high  well i started walking the long way home  just to think of an alibi  well i couldn't think of a darn gawn thing  that hadn't already been said  so i guess i better just play it by ear  cause i'm already dead  well i really had a ball last night  i held all the pretty boys tight  i was feelin' single  seein' double  wound up in a whole lotta trouble  but today i'll face the big fight  but i really had a ball last night  yes today i'll face the big fight  but i really had a ball last night  i crossed on the river  there'll be no returning  i crossed all the bridges  i watched them all burning  and now i'm a stranger  to a strange land i'm driven  where all is forgotten  and nothing's forgiven    but i cried a river  a river for him  that's deeper and wider  than i'll ever swim  the heart it will harden  the sorrow will dim  but i cried a river  a river for him    i think of him now  on the road i am taking  and wonder how long  his heart will be breaking  but he'll never hear when  the teardrops are falling  or the sound of my voice  and the name i'm calling    but i cried a river  a river for him  that's deeper and wider  than i'll ever swim  the heart it will harden  the sorrow will dim  but i cried a river  a river for him    so sweep for the sons  and the dear darling daughters  for the passing of time  and the parting of waters  for all who have passed through  this world long before me  to a far distant shore line  where no one waits for me  but i cried a river  a river for him  that's deeper and wider  than i'll ever swim  the heart it will harden  the sorrow will dim  but i cried a river  a river for him long long time ago when we were young  you swore to me i would be the one  i would be the one you loved  but we had to part  you asked me to wait for you  to keep you in my heart  to keep you in my heart    night after lonely night i'm waiting for you still  high above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill    now maybe i am the foolish kind to think of you so long  have you found another love  am i still the one  am i still the one for you  but you're far away  do you ever dream of coming back to me someday  back to me someday    night after lonely night i'm waiting for you still  high above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill    on heartbreak hill alone at night  i think of how you held me tight  and wonder if i ever will see you again  on heartbreak hill    oh lord if i only could go back in time enough  i'd hold you in my arms again  never let you go  never let you go my love  and leave me far behind  high upon this lonely hill were you swore to be mine  you swore to be mine    night after lonely night i'm waiting for you still  high above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill  night after lonely night i'm waiting for you still  high above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill  here on heartbreak hill  here on heartbreak hill every night it's the same  i feel your heart turn cold as rain  and know that you'll be gone again  i hear the front door close  you say you got to go downtown  i guess there's someone else you've found  so why you're still coming round  heaven only knows    heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry  make me feel like i could die  that's the way it goes  heaven only ever sees  how love's made a fool of me  i guess that's how it's meant to be but  heaven only knows    i've heard it said that talk is cheap  but still your words they cut so deep  lay me crying in my sleep  and the pain just grows  i don't know who's right or wrong  but all we had is dead and gone  so why you keep me hanging on  heaven only knows    heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry  make me feel like i could die  that's the way it goes  heaven only ever sees  how love's made a fool of me  i guess that's how it's meant to be but  heaven only knows    i'm going to turn and walk away  there's nothing left for me to say  it wouldn't change things anyway  though  i suppose  the love i gave was always true  well  i don't know what else to do  and how i'll ever get over you  heaven only knows    heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry  make me feel like i could die  that's the way it goes  heaven only ever sees  how love's made a fool of me  i guess that's how it's meant to be but  heaven only knows don't think that i'll be hangin' 'round while you're havin' fun  i won't sit there cryin' over you  well from now on when you step out i'll tell you what i'll do  i'll lock the door  put out the cat and i'll go steppin' too  yes i'll go steppin' too  my honey i'll go steppin' too  i'll lock the door  put out the cat and i'll go steppin' too  now every time you come in

go steppin' too  my honey i'll go steppin' too  i'll lock the door  put out the cat and i'll go steppin' too  from now on when you come in and won't tell where you been  with your hair messed up and

it burned my eyes  burned so hot i thought i'd died  thought i'd died and gone to hell  lookin' for the water from a deeper well  i went to the river but the river was dry  i fell to my knees  and i looked to the sky  i looked to the sky  and the spring rain fell  i saw the water from a deeper well    well  lookin' for the water from a deeper well  well  lookin' for the water from a deeper well    i was ready for love  i was ready for the money  ready for the blood and ready for the honey  ready for the winnin'  ready for the bell  lookin' for the water from a deeper well  i found some love and i found some money  found that blood would drip from the honey  found i had a thirst that i could not quell  lookin' for the water from a deeper well    well  lookin' for the water from a deeper well  well  lookin' for the water from a deeper well    well  i did it for kicks and i did it for faith  i did it for lust and i did it for hate  i did it for need and i did it for love  addiction stayed on tight like a glove  so i ran with the moon and i ran with the night  and the three of us were a terrible sight  nipple to the bottle  to the gun  to the cell  to the bottom of a hole of a deeper well    well  lookin' for the water from a deeper well  well  lookin' for the water from a deeper well    i rocked with the cradle and i rolled with the rage  i shook those walls and i rattled that gage  i took my trouble down a dead-end trail  reachin' out a hand for a holier grail  hey there  mama  did you carry that load?  did you tell your baby 'bout the bend in the road  'bout the rebel yell  'bout the one that fell?  lookin' for the water from a deeper well...    well  lookin' for the water from a deeper well  well  lookin' for the water from a deeper well hey pretty baby are

town  but no local yokel's gonna shut me down  cause me and the boys got this rig unwound  and we've come a thousand miles from the guitar town    nothin' ever happened round my home town  and i ain't the kind to just hang around  but i heard someone callin' my name one day  and i followed that voice down the lost highway  everybody told me you can't get far  now i'm smokin' into texas with the hammer down  and a rockin' little combo from the guitar town    hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault  love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt  wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop  stumble in the restaurant  wonderin' why i don't stop  well i gotta keep rockin' while i still can  got a two-pack habit and a motel tan  when my boots hit the boards it's a brand new hand  put my back to the risers and make my stand  hey pretty baby won't you hold me tight  i'm loadin' up and rollin' out of here tonight  one of these days i'm gonna settle down  and i'll take you back with me to the guitar town  lainie marsh   i hear the clock a tickin'  see the sweat upon my brow  i know my destination  nothing's gonna stop me now  i'm running on desire  baby i've got nerves of steel  coming down to the wire  lord above me guide the wheel  keep me in your prayers tonight  i'll be weary upon that road  i know the finish line's in sight  but i still have a ways to go  there's a junkyard dog a barkin'  in the valley down below  he's wanting me to stop and  gather up a heavy load  ain't gonna heed his call  ain't givin' him the time of day  you mangy mutt once and for all  i said i threw that stuff away  i won't have a bit of trouble  heading down the straight and true  i'll fly solo on the double  into the yonder blue  i might need some intervention  out upon the icy turn  in a foggy situation  squealin' on a hairpin curve  i'm running on desire  baby i've got nerves of steel  coming down to the wire  lord above me guide the wheel  keep me in your prayers tonight  i'll be weary upon that road  i know the finish line's in sight  but i still have a ways to go  keep me in your prayers tonight  i'll be weary upon that road  i know the finish line's in sight  but i still have a ways to go  got a ways to go  got a ways to go    leonard cohen     say a prayer for the cowgirl her horse ran away  she'll walk 'til she finds him her darlin' her stray  but the river's in flood and the roads are awash  and the bridges break up in the panic of loss    and there's nothin' to follow nowhere to go  he's gone like the summer gone like the snow  and the crickets are breaking her heart with their song  as the day caves in and the night is all wrong    did she dream was it he who went galloping past  and bent down the fern broke open the grass  and printed the mud with the well-hammered shoe  that she nailed to his speed in the dreams of her youth    and although he goes grazin' a minute away  she tracks him all night she tracks him all day  and she's blind to his presence except to compare  her injury here with his punishment there    then at home on a branch on a highest tree  a songbird sings out so suddenly  and the sun is warm and the soft winds ride  on a willow tree by the riverside    ah the world is sweet and world is wide  he's there where the light and the darkness divide  and the steam's comin' off him he's huge and he's shy  and he steps on the moon when he paws at the sky    and he comes to her hand but he's not really tame  he longs to be lost she longs for the same  and he'll bolt and he'll plunge thru the first open pass  to roll and to feed in the sweet mountain grass    or he'll make a break for the high plateau  where there's nothing above and nothing below  it's time for their burden the whip and the spur  will she ride with him or will he ride with her    so she binds herself to her galloping steed  and he binds himself to the woman in need  and there is no space just left and right  and there is no time but there is day and night    then she leans on his neck and whispers low  whither thou goest i will go  and they turn as one and they head for the plain  no need for the whip or no need for the rein    now the clasp of this union who fastens it tight  who snaps it asunder the very next night  some say it's him some say it's her  some say love's like smoke beyond all repair    so my darlin' my darlin' just let him go by  that old silhouette on the great western sky  and i'll pick out a tune and they'll move right along  and they're gone like smoke and they're gone like this song    say a prayer for the cowgirl in my hour of darkness  in my time of need  oh lord  grant me vision  oh lord  grant me speed    once i knew a young man  went driving through the night  miles and miles without a word  with just his high-beam lights    who'd have ever thought  they'd build such a deadly denver bend  to be so strong  to take so long  as it would till the end    in my hour of darkness  in my time of need  oh lord  grant me vision  oh lord  grant me speed    another young man safely strummed  his silver string guitar  and he played to people everywhere  some say he was a star    but he was just a country boy  his simple songs confess  and the music he had in him  so very few possess    in my hour of darkness  in my time of need  oh lord  grant me vision  oh lord  grant me speed    then there was an old man  kind and wise with age  and he read me just like a book  and he never missed a page    and i loved him like my father  and i loved him like my friend  and i knew his time would shortly come  but i did not know just when    in my hour of darkness  in my time of need  oh lord  grant me vision  oh lord  grant me speed  oh lord  grant me vision  oh lord  grant me speed  david olney     man you should have seen me way back then  i could tell a tale  i could make a spin  i could tell you black was white i could tell you day was night  not only that i could tell you why  back then i could really tel a lie    well i'd hire a kid to say he was lame  then i'd touch him and make him walk again  then i'd pull some magic trick i'd pretend to heal the sick  i was takin' everything they had to give  it wasn't all that bad a way to live    well i'm in this desert town and it's hot as hell  but no one's buyin' what i got to sell  i make my lame kid walk i make a dumb guy talk  i'm preachin' up a storm both night and day  but everyone just turns and walks away    well i can see that i'm only wasting time  so i head across the road to drink some wine  this old man comes up to me he says i seen you on the street  you're pretty good if i do say myself  but the guy that come thru here last month he was somethin' else    instead of callin' out for fire from above  he just gets real quiet and talks about love  and i'll tell you somethin' funny he didn't want nobody's money  now i'm not exactly sure what this all means  but it's the damndest thing i swear i've ever seen    well since that time every town is the same  i can't make a dime  i don't know why i came  i decide i'll go and find him and find out who's behind him  he has everyone convinced that he's for real  well i figure we can work us out a deal    so he offers me a job and i say fine  he says i'll get paid off on down the line  well i guess i'll string along don't see how too much can go wrong  as long as he pays my way i guess i'll follow  we're headed for jerusalem tomorrow you call me from a phone booth with tears in your voice  tell me you've been out all night runnin' with the boys  you say you're cold and tired and lonely  and you got no place to go  there wasn't any phonebook  mine's the only number that you know    well call yourself a taxi and i'll pay 'i'm at the door  if you don't mind sleepin' on the sofa or on the floor  and i spend an hour hatin' you  'til the cab pulls in  my heart has found another way  to be loving you again    and every time is the last time  and every time is the first  everytime is the last time with you  oh it never gets no better  and it couldn't get no wore    then i hear the footsteps the driver's at the door  he says i look familiar has he made this run before  and i tell him i don't think so  what's it matter anyway  just tell me what the meter reads  and i'll go and get your pay    well now it's down to you and me though it don't seem right  we both know where we'll be and what we'll do tonight  and after an hour or two  when the night comes to an end  my heart has found another way  to be lovin' you again    and every time is the last time  and every time is the first  everytime is the last time with you  oh it never gets no better  and it couldn't get no worse    i know that there should be more to say i'll just reed your mind  let's save what's left unsaid for another time  'cause i know there'll be another time  so until then  my heart has found another way  to be lovin' you again  my heart has found another way  to be lovin' you again  oh  my heart has found another way  to be lovin' you againlast night i dreamed about you  i dreamed that you were older  you were looking like picasso  with a scar across your shoulder  you were kneeling by the river  you were digging up the bodies  buried long ago  michelangelo    last night i dreamed about you  i dreamed you were a pilgrim  on a highway out alone to find  the mother of your children  who were still unborn and waiting  in the wings of some desire  abandoned long ago  michelangelo    were you there at armageddon  was paris really burning  could i have been the one to pull you  from the point of no returning  and did i hear you calling out my name  or was it forgotten long ago  michelangelo    last night i dreamed about you  i dreamed that you were riding  on a blood red painted pony  up where the heavens were dividing  and the angels turned to ashes  you came tumbling with them to earth  so far below  michelangelo    last night i dreamed about you  i dreamed that you were dying  in a field of thorn and roses  with a hawk about you crying  for the warrior slain in battle  from an arrow driven deep inside you  long ago  michelangelo    did you suffer at the end  would there be no one to remember  did you banish all the old ghosts  with the terms of surrender  and could you hear me calling out your name  well i guess that i will never know  michelangelo    last night i dreamed about you  i dreamed that you were weeping  and your tears poured down like diamonds  for a love beyond all keeping  and you caught them one by one  in a million silk bandannas that i gave you long ago  michelangelo he said "oh my love. oh my antonia  you with the dark eyes and palest of skin  tonight i am going from santa maria  wait for me till i'm in your arms once again"    she held me  she kissed me  begged me not to leave her  to cross on 1he mountain my fortune to win  but a letter now tells me she died of a fever  i'll never see her in this world again    you are my sorrow  you are my splendor  you are my shelter through storm and through strife  you are the one i will always remember  all off the days of my life    i curse the ambition that took me far from her  for a treasure not ever so fine or so fair  as the flash of her smile or the touch of her fingers  the fire in her heart and the smell of her hair    she left me a note that cried "do not weep for me  behold you are with me as sure as the stars  that rise in the evening to shine down upon me  behold i am with you wherever you are"    i can still hear him. he calls to me only  what once was begotten shall come to no end  but the road is so long and the nights are so lonely  my soul just to hold him in this world again    you are my sorrow  you are my splendor  you are my shelter through storm and through strife  you are the one i will always remember  all of the days of my life    oh my love  oh my antonia  you with the dark eyes and palest of skin  how could i know that night in santa maria  i'd never see you in this world again o evangeline you been gone so long  and for a time it seemed  every road you took turned wrong  but a second chance would come  with each new bridge you burned  i know you squandered some  but then from some you learned  and the point of rescue well  you passed that long ago  o but to hear you teil it was  just another part of the show  o evangeline your faith shone blind and true  we raise our glass and sing  of you evangeline    o evangeline you with no kith or kin  the nights so hard and mean  you shed them like a skin  for you were always strong  when the bad slid down to worse  you still had that song  it was your blessing and your curse  but in your tongue  there is no word for home  there'll be no one  to roll away the stone  o evangeline you have been a prisoner here  bread and roses we shall bring  to you evangeline    o evangeline what are you fighting for  you stayed out in that ring  when nobody's even keepin' score  but round by round you earned  your stumble into grace  still with every turn the world  becomes a sadder place  it swallows up the ones  you have loved the most  so you sleep with none  you wake with ghosts  o evangeline  you have salted with your tears  every lonely mile you've seen  through the years evangeline    it's a fatal shore  you now wash upon  so weary of the war  and no longer young  o evangeline your voice  risin' sweet and clear  we close our eyes and dream  of you evangeline oh my mama told me  'cause she say she learned the hard way  say she wanna spare the children  she say don't give or sell your soul away  'cause all that you have is your soul    [chorus: ]  don't be tempted by the shiny apple  don't you eat of the bitter fruit  hunger only for a taste of justice  hunger only for a world of truth  'cause all that you have is your soul    i was a pretty young girl once  i had dreams  i had high hopes  i married a man he stole my heart away  he gave his love but what a high price i paid  and all that you have is your soul    why was i such a young fool  thought i'd make history  making babies was the best i could do  thought i'd made something that could be mine forever  found out the hard way one can't possess another  and all that you have is your soul    [chorus: ]    i thought  thought that i could find a way  to beat the system  to make a deal and have no debts to pay  i'd take it all  take it all i'd run away  me for myself first class and first rate  but all that you have is your soul    here i am waiting for a better day  a second chance  a little luck to come my way  a hope to dream a hope that i can sleep again  and wake in the world with a clear conscience and clean hands  'cause all that you have is your soul    [chorus: ]    oh my mama told me  'cause she said she learned the hard way  she said she want to spare the children  she said it don't give to sell your soul away  all that you have is your soul  all that you have  all that you have  all that you have  all that you have is your soul i meant to ask you how to fix that car  i always meant to ask you about the war  and what you saw across a bridge too far  did it leave a scar    or how you navigated wings of fire and steel  up where heaven had no more secrets to conceal  and still you found the ground beneath your wheels  how did it feel    bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly  to dust be returning from dust we begin  bang the drum slowly i'll speak of things holy  above and below me world without end    i meant to ask you how when everything seemed lost  and your fate was in a game of dice they tossed  there was still that line that you would never cross  at any cost    i meant to ask you how you lived what you believed  with nothing but your heart up your sleeve  and if you ever really were deceived  by the likes of me    bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly  to dust be returning from dust we begin  bang the drum slowly i'll speak of things holy  above and below me world without end    gone now is the day and gone the sun  there is peace tonight all over arlington  but the songs of my life will still be sung  by the light of the moon you hung    i meant to ask you how to plow that field  i meant to bring you water from the well  and be the one beside you when you fell  could you tell    bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly  to dust be returning from dust we begin  bang the drum slowly i'll speak of things holy  above and below me world without end i was once a broken man  i was once a broken fool  lost my wife and children  to one basic broken rule  now i live my life in silence  tho' i'm not quite in a shell  drink and listen to that song  a whiter shade of pale  a whiter shade of pale    i was good shad tree mechanic  so i send myself to school  they smoothed off my rough edges  in my hands they put new tools  the instructor once he told me  i could work on any line  i could tend and make any diesel sing  just like patsy cline  just like patsy cline    well i met my wife to be  through my mother's best friend's son  she had been a bar room singer  she was as good as anyone  but i ask her to stop singing  and the girl she did not flinch  next day she went and bought that man  a brand new crescent wrench  ohh  a brand new crescent wrench    we had three fine children  as eight years went on by  and earned a silver visor  the knuckles stayed bone dry  but after supper i kept hearin' her  by the kitchen radio  singing sweet but desperate harmony  a little bit to low  ohhh  a little bit to low    she left three months later  i'd just come home for lunch  note said "easy come  hard go"  i still love you so much  she said i don't know if i'll be there  or if you'll want me when i come  but if and when that abbott steer  you better  let my sweet dream run  ohhh  let my sweet dream run    ohhhh...ohhh...ohhh...ohhh    i was good shad tree mechanic  so i send myself to school  they smoothed off my rough edges  in my hands they put new tools  the instructor once he told me  i could work on any line  but now the diesels aren't the only thing that sing  just like patsy cline  just like patsy cline    i was once a broken man  i was once a broken fool  lost my wife and children  to one basic broken rule  now i live my life in silence  tho' i'm not quite in a shell  drink and listen to that song  a whiter shade of pale  a whiter shade of pale  a whiter shade of pale  a whiter shade of pale when they carried you into the parlor  your wounds were the worst i'd seen  cold as snow as your body trembled  cradled in the arms of morphine  all the kinfolk cried out loud  "good shepherd save this man"  but you whispered with icy breath  "it is not in his hands " and you said  "heaven ain't ready for me yet " and you looked at me  "give me your heart and take a bet " and you held my hand  "now i've seen your face  now that we've met  "i shall not slip away"  mama said to me  "daughter  "you must nurse your cousin well"  so i cared for you through days and nights  but your fever i did not quell  for weeks i watched you suffer pain  that no laudanum could ease  all i had left to do is pray  "lord have mercy on him please " and you said  "heaven ain't ready for me yet " and you looked at me  "give me your heart and take a bet " and you held my hand  "now i've seen your face  now that we've met  "i shall not slip away"  now winter's lights has cooled the air  at last your strength's returned  you talk to me of the life you spent  and of the life you've earned  you'll waste no time on vengeance  you've no wish to fight again  "to find peace " you say  "in god we trust  "but little faith in man"  heaven ain't' ready for you yet  jesse  i'll give you my heart  i'll take a bet  jesse  now i've seen your face  now that we've met  i shall not slip away i have seen your soul turn black  and then retreat  to that dark place where no one else may follow  i waited here for your returning  to roll your cigarette  and wash your bloodied feet    you have heard the silent running  of my dreams  broke me from the grip of grief and fever  with the sound of your voice speaking my name  and a kiss  that i will feel forever    in the hour of gold  the hour of lead  wg did forge our wedding bed  on a hard and holy road  we lay down our head  in tha hour of gold  the hour oi lead    i have watched you riding on  the wall of death  and when il finally breaks you and you fall  i will tear this dress of muslin that you gave me  to bind the fatal wound  and catch your last sweet breath    in the hour of gold  the hour of lead  we did forge our wedding bed  on a hard and holy road  we lay down our head  in the hour of gold  the hour of lead    but the world will be my witness when  they excavate my heart  and find the image of your face  imprinted there like some shroud of turin  that neither time nor tundra could erase

open  she flung her diamond ring  said  give it away  just give it away    and i said  now honey  don't you even want your half of everything  she said give it away  just give it away        so  i'm still right here where she left me  along with all the other things that she don't care about anymore  hmm    like that picture from our honeymoon  that night in 'frisco bay  she said give it away  well  i can't give it away  that big four poster king sized bed  where all our love was made  she said give it away  well  i can't give it away    i've got furnished house  a diamond ring  and a lonely  broken heart  full of love  and i can't even give it away well  love can be an uphill climb  i'm gonna meet a lot of resistance  it takes every ounce of strength we've got  if we're gonna go the distance  we can get discouraged and lose our courage  worrying 'bout the daily grind  but life's a journey  no need to hurry  it's one day at a time      one foot in front of the other  take one step then take another  keep on walkin'  we're headed in the right direction  puttin' one foot in front of the other  little by little gets a whole lot further  hittin' our stride  one foot in front of the other    what's down the road we can't say  and the road behind don't matter  but every mile along the way  is just another mile together  unconcerned about the twists and turns  we're takin' it nice and slow  safe and sound  covering ground  steady as she goes        yesterday is dead and gone  and tomorrow takes care of itself  we'll just keep on keepin' on  'cause we ain't stumbled yet    one foot in front of the other  take one step and then take another  just a-walkin' and a-talkin' and a-movin' in the same direction  just puttin' one foot in front of the other  little by little gets a whole lot further  hittin' our stride  one foot in front of the other    well  just a-hittin' our stride  one foot in front of the other oh  i've been stumblin' through the darkness  tryin' to feel the ground beneath my feet  afraid of movin' much in any direction  stuck where the past and the future meet    but i fin'lly got my first good look  a little fire was all it too  an' as the flames grew brighter  i saw everything that i'd missed  once you get your courage up  you light a match an' your eyes adjust  it's amazing what a man can see  by the light of a burnin' bridge    an' there were things i saw that i'm not proud of  things that i'd do diff'rent now from then  but when i really make myself get honest  it's over and i can't go back again    'cause i fin'lly got my first good look  a little fire was all it took  an' as the flames grew brighter  i saw everything that i'd missed  once you get your courage up  you light a match an' your eyes adjust  it's amazing what a man can see  by the light of a burnin' bridge    it sure is hard to let go and to leave the past behind  but there ain't no other way that you can find some peace of mind    when i fin'lly got my first good look  a little fire was all it took  an' as the flames grew brighter  i saw everything that i'd missed  once you get your courage up  you light a match an' your eyes adjust  it's amazing what a man can see  by the light of a burnin' bridge  it's amazing what a man can see  by the light of a burnin' bridge the walls that surround us are slowly crumblin' down  but the heart of this foundation is still on solid ground  just need some renovation and a lot of tlc  and a long night of lovin' is all that we both need    so roll the shades down  lock the doors up tight  turn on the code-a-phone  if the door bell rings  we'll just stay in bed and pretend nobody's home  let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent  there ain't nothing wrong with this old house  it just needs a little home improvement    every day we go our separate ways  to make our dreams come true  but it ain't worth the sacrifice  if we're giving up me and you  we gotta hold on tighter than tight  to the lies that make us strong  and get back to the roots  that made this house a home    so roll the shades down  lock the doors up tight  turn on the code-a-phone  if the door bell rings  we'll just stay in bed and pretend nobody's home  let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent  there ain't nothing wrong with this old house  it just needs a little home

falls  and the lights of vegas  i've criss-crossed down to key biscayne  and chi-town via bangor  maine  think i've seen it all  and all i can say is      how 'bout them cowgirls  boys ain't they something  sure are some proud girls  and you can't tell them nothing  and i tell you right now girls  may just be seven wonders of this big  whole round world  but how 'bout them cowgirls    she's riding colts in steamboat springs  bailing hay outside abilene  she's trying hard  to fit in some city  but her home is 'neath that big  blue sky  and the northern plains and those other wide open spaces  now a-days there ain't as many but        boy  she don't need you and she don't need me  she can do just fine on her own two feet  but she wants a man who wants her to be herself  and she'll never change  don't know how to hide  her stubborn will or her fighting side  but you treat her right and she'll love you like no one else    yeah  how 'bout them cowgirls  boys ain't they something  sure are some proud girls  but you can't beat their loving    and i'll tell you right now girls  may just be seven wonders of this big  old round world  but how 'bout them cowgirls  how 'bout 'em boys i pack up my saddle  throw it in that two-horse trailer  back up my truck  hook 'em up  and drive away  won't be the first time  but this time's the last time  she meant it when she said  that's all i've got to say  never had been thrown like this before  i ain't her cowboy anymore    never saw it comin'  but i knew where it was goin'  when she asked how long this time  before i hit the road  she didn't come right out and say it  but i sure got the message  when i reached out to hold her  that shoulder sure was cold  figured i'd just let goodbye run its course  i ain't her cowboy anymore      these white lines are a blur  like the last few nights i spent with her  i don't know where i went wrong  or if i did  like the good ol' boy i am  i told her that i understand  but lord knows that i won't long as i live  seems lately every time it rains it pours  i ain't her cowboy anymore    we met in denver  settled down in dallas  the best days of my life  were the ones i spent with her  you'd think that all that lovin' ought to count for something  guess i wore out my welcome  like the rowels of these old spurs  that casper sunset's what i'm shootin' for  'cause i ain't her cowboy anymore        her cowboy anymore  i ain't her cowboy anymore he was sitting there beside me throwing doubles down  when he ordered up his third one he looked around  then he looked at me  and said  "i do believe  i'll have one more."  he said  "i hate this bar and i hate to drink   but on second thought  tonight i think  i hate everything."    then he opened up his billfold and threw a twenty down   and a faded photograph fell out and hit the ground.  i picked it up   he said  "thank you  bud."  i put it in his hand.  he said  "i probably oughta throw this one away  'cause she's the reason i feel this way.  i hate everything."    i hate my job  and i hate my life  and if it weren't for my two kids  i'd hate my ex wife.  i know i should move on and try to start again   but i just can't get over her leaving me for him.  then he shook his head  looked down at his ring  said  "i hate everything."    said  "that one bedroom apartment where i get my mail   is really not a home  it's more like a jail   with a swimming pool  and a parking lot view.  man  it's just great.  i hate summer  winter  fall and spring.  red and yellow  purple  blue and green.  i hate everything."    i hate my job  and i hate my life  and if it weren't for my two kids  i'd hate my ex wife.  i know i should move on and try to start again   but i just can't get over her leaving me for him.  then he shook his head  looked down at his ring  said  "i hate everything."    so i pulled out my phone and i called my house.  i said  "babe  i'm coming home  we're gonna work this out."  i payed for his drinks  and i told him thanks  thanks for everything. if the whole world was a honky-tonk   and it revolved around an old jukebox   we'd tell our troubles to the bar   over cryin' steel guitars   and soon  they'd all be gone.  yeah  if you asked me what i thought   i'd say: "we'd be better off   "if the whole world was a honky-tonk."    you could smoke that cigarette   an' be politically incorrect.  show off that red 'round your neck:  not hear a single soul object.  wouldn't need no lawyers to decide   who is wrong and who is right.  no need for big expensive trials:  brother  we'd just step outside.    if the whole world was a honky-tonk   and it revolved around an old jukebox   we'd tell our troubles to the bar   over cryin' steel guitars   and soon  they'd all be gone.  yeah  if you asked me what i thought   i'd say: "we'd be better off   "if the whole world was a honky-tonk."    wouldn't have to pay no tax:  just set a tip jar in the back.  if we ran low  we'd pass the hat:  i bet we'd all be in the black   if the whole world was a honky-tonk.    and if you're lookin' love:  someone to heal that broken heart.  hey  buddy  you'd be in half.  you wouldn't have to go that far.    if the whole world was a honky-tonk   and it revolved around an old jukebox   we'd tell our troubles to the bar   over cryin' steel guitars   and soon  they'd all be gone.  if you asked me what i thought   i'd say: "we'd be better off   "if the whole world was a honky-tonk."    life would be a three-chord song   and the king would be george jones   if the whole world was a honky-tonk. would you like to live

didn't know what my future would hold   but you gave me a chance   so i set out on the road.    it wasn't easy going then.  there were times i almost threw that old towel in   but you kept callin' me back to the stage   and i finally found my place in each and every face.    i'm not sayin' i'm through by any means.  there's still things that i want to say and do.  i hope you won't forget me

ground again  til i walk out and get back on that bus that got me here.  i don't know how many more years i've got left to do this   but i figure a few.  i do want you to know  though   that when i do walk off this stage for the last time   and i'm all settled in  away from all this   you won't be far away.  i'll still hear your screams and cheers in my mind.  and i'll always remember you.    i'm

a rail in a cotton dress  summer tanned pretty  little perfect mess  with a story that could only be anybody's guess  and i was thinking that i probably didn't stand a chance  but i rolled up my sleeves  walked up and i said  hey  i don't know you but i'd kinda like a shot  she said  i saw you comin' over  i already thought it over  and ok  so now what    and i said  well i got a car  she said  there's something  at least it's a start  i said  it's better than nothing  i ain't in no hurry but i'm ready when you are  and she said  where do you think all this is going  i said  there ain't no way of knowing  i guess i hadn't thought it through that far  but i got a car    so  we let the wheels turn and the windows down  we let ourselves go all the way through town  she never said stop and i never asked her why  we drove into the night  when outta nowhere  she said  i'd give anything to never go back there  and i kinda wish this day would never end  she said  i could use a change but i don't even know where    and i said  well i got a car  she said  there's something  at least it's a start  i said  it's better than nothing  i ain't in no hurry but i'm ready when you are  and she said  where do you think all this is going  i said  there ain't no way of knowing  i really hadn't thought it through that far  and i can't promise you the moon and stars  but i got a car    we got lost in the miles  lost track of the days  'til we finally found a stopping place  when the doctor's said  you know what's on the way?  and we found ourselves in a little white house  one sunday morning  rain pouring down  she said  i think it's time but all the lines are out    and her eyes teared up and she said  what are we gonna do now?  and i said  well i got a car  she said  there's something  you think it'll start  i said  it's already running  got your things in the back and i'm ready when you are  she said  are you sure it'll get us where we're goin'?  i said  if there's one thing i know girl  it's gotten us this far  and i don't mean to hurry but i'm ready when you are at a truck stop in st angelo  saw a bill board about this rodeo  this weekend out in el paso  so i signed up to ride    i drew a bull called "original sin"  heard he'd killed a couple of men  figured this was something i could win  'cause the devil was on my side  i was havin' myself one hell of a ride  but i ended up disqualified  that bull just up and died  before they blew the whistle      with those north texas blues   thought i'd paid all my dues  then those south texas blues   told me "son  you ain't through"  had the east texas blues and the west texas too  i've done all i know to do   tryin' to lose  tryin' to lose   these ol' lone star blues.    well i got laid off at brown and rue  then on my way back to cuttin' chute  i lost my wrist watch and my boots  shootin' dice with a dude from houston  well there ain't no jobs here workin' cattle  so i got on the part time haulin' gravel  with some outfit from seattle out here building custom homes        well i gassed my truck and i packed my clothes  turned in my key and i hit the road  i said "cow town's where i'll go   you never know  i might get lucky!"    well i got a friend there turning knobs  at a place called billy bobs  said thought he could get me a job there  workin' as a bouncer  first night on the job was just insane  some ol' boy got all deranged  hit me in the head with a harley chain  to this day  my ears still ring!        i've done all i know to do   tryin' to lose  tryin' to lose  these ol' lone star bluespity a man for he don't know  the trouble he'll pass goin' down life's road    when a man is one and twenty he thinks he knows it all  he can't see down the road of life where he'll ever fall  but fall he will as he travels through life  with all its pitfalls troubles and strife    now at 50 he's goin' real strong  he has him a family and a nice little home  but old age is creeping up his spine  and the day is comin' when the sun won't shine    now at 60 he won't have to guess  he's already missed the boat that leads to success  but he's done his best and he can't see why  the fame of life just passed him by    now at 70 he can see the light  and he knows he's never been very bright  but he's done his best as he's travelled by  and now all he can do is just sit and sigh    pity a man for he don't know  the trouble he'll pass goin' down life's road    now at 80 he's ready for the wreath  he's wore out his hair and two sets of teeth  he has rheumatism in his hands and feet  and nothin' seems good to eat    so you can pity him as he goes up the line  as he wobbles on the spindle and his almost blind  and you can tell by the way that he travels alone  that it won't be long before he's goin' home    but if he's kept the commandments as he's travelled through life  he'll have a home in heaven where there'll be no strife  he's worked all his life to get things the way he wants 'em  he comes here against his will and he goes away disappointed it's knowin' that your door is always open  and your path is free to walk  that makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag  rolled up and stashed behind your couch  and it's knowin' i'm not shackled  by forgotten words and bonds  and the ink stains that have dried upon some line  that keeps you in the back roads  by the rivers of my memory  that keeps you ever gentle on my mind    it's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy  planted on their columns now that bind me  or something that somebody said because  they thought we fit together walkin'  it's just knowing that the world  will not be cursing or forgiving  when i walk along some railroad track and find  that you're movin' on the back roads  by the rivers of my memory  and for hours you're just gentle on my mind    though the wheat fields and the clothes lines  and the junkyards and the highways come between us  and some other woman's cryin' to her mother  'cause she turned and i was gone  i still might run in silence  tears of joy might stain my face  and the summer sun might burn me till i'm blind  but not to where i cannot see  you walkin' on the back roads  by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind    i dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron  in some train yard  my beard a roughening coal pile  and a dirty hat pulled low across my face  through cupped hands 'round a tin can  i pretend to hold you to my breast and find  that you're waitin' from the back roads  by the rivers of my memory  ever smilin'  ever gentle on my mind if you go away on this summer day then you might as well take the sun away  all the birds that flew in the summer sky  when our love was new and our hearts were high  when the day was young and the nights were long    and the moon stood still for the night bird's song  if you go away if you go away if you go away  but if you'll stay i'll make you a day like no day has been or will be again  we'll sail the sun we'll glide on the rain we'll talk to the trees and worshipthe wind    then if you go i'll understand leave me just enough love to fill up my hand  if you go away if you go away if you go away  if you go away as i know you will you must tell the world to stop turning  'til you return again if you ever do for what good is love without loving you    can i tell you now as you turn to go i'll be dying slow to the next hello  if you go away if you go away if you go away  if you go away as i know you might there'll be nothing left in the world totrust  just an empty room full of empty space like the empty look i see on your face    i have been the shadow of your shadow  if i thought it might have kept me by your side  if you go away if you go away if you go away  but if you'll stay i'll make you a night like no night has been or will beagain    i'll sail on your smile i'll glide on your touch i'll talk to your eyes that ilove so much  but if you go i know i will cry and all the good is gone from the wordsgoodbye  if you go away if you go away if you go away please don't go away sometimes i imagine myself as a drifter  a seeker of fortune  connoisseur of great wines  dashin' through meadows of yellow and green  tryin' to catch the impossible dream  a-leavin' the straight life behind    sometimes my thoughts found me way down in mexico  a-drinkin' tequila goin' out of my mind  havin' a ball on a couple 'a bob  a-treatin' the ladies to corn on the cob  a-leavin' the straight life behind    and suddenly all my silly thoughts disappear  she comes to me softly with crackers and beer  a-winkin' and blinkin' and blowin' my ear  a-runnin' away with my mind    it's great to be in love  i'm not really thinkin' of  a-leavin' the straight life behind  i'm just playin' a game in my-why mind    once in a while in my mind i go a-bummin'  a-goin' nowhere  with no worry of time  runnin' along chasin' after a train  hummin' a song in the sun and the rain  a-leavin' the straight life behind    i can just see me on a tropical island  a-ridin' the surf and drinkin' coconut wine  havin' me fun with the girls in the sand  chasin' the sun through an innocent land  a-leavin' the straight life behind    suddenly all my silly thoughts disappear  she comes to me softly with crackers and beer  a-winkin' and blinkin' and blowin' my ear  a-runnin' away with my mind    it's great to be in love  i'm not really thinkin' of  a-leavin' the straight life behind  i'm just playin' a game in my-why mind you better sit down kids  i'll tell you

little things 'cause  i won't be here to stop them anymore    well  i have to go now  so kiss me goodbye  my eyes are just red  kids  i'm too big to crywell  it's four o'clock in the afternoon  and the anchors have been weighed  from miami to nassau  she's bound across the waves  she'll be headin' south through biscayne bay  into the open sea  yarmouth castle  she's a-dyin' and don't know it  now the many years she's been to sea  she's seen the better times  she gives a groan of protest  as they cast away her lines  and the grumble of her engines  and the rust along her spine  tells the castle she's too old to be sailin'  but the sands run out within her heart  a tiny spark glows red  it smolders through the evening  there's laughter overhead  now the dinner's served and the cards are dealt  and the drinks are passed around  deep within the fire starts a-burnin'  now it's midnight on the open sea  and the moon is shinin' bright  some people join the party  and others say goodnight  there's many who are sleepin' now  it's been a busy day  and a tiny wisp of smoke is a-risin'  "oh lord " she groans  "i'm burning  let someone understand"  but her silent plea is wasted  in the playin' of the band  everybody's dancin' on her deck  and they're havin' such a time  and a voice says  "shut up and deal  i'm losin'"  deep within the yarmouth castle  the fire begins to glow  it leaps into the hallways  and climbs and twists and grows  and the paint she wore to keep her young  oh lord  how well it burns  and soon that old fire is a-ragin'  up beneath the bridge it's climbin' fast  the captain stands aloft  he calls up to the boatswain  says  "boatswain  we are lost"  for the ragged hoses in the racks  no pressure do they hold  and the people down below will soon be dyin'  all amidships  oh she's blazin' now  it's spreadin' fore and aft  the people are a-scramblin'  as the fire blocks their path  the evil smoke surrounds them  and they're fallin' in their tracks  and the captain in his lifeboat is a-leavin'  oh then the ship  bahama star  comes steamin' through the night  she sees the castle blazin'  and 'tis a terrible sight  "jump down  jump down"  the captain cries  "we'll save you if we can"  then the paint on his funnels is a-fryin'  "god help the ones who sleep below  and cannot find the way  thank god for those we rescue  upon this awful day"  now the heroes  they are many  but the times are growin' slim  and now from stern to bow  she's a-blazin'  oh the yarmouth castle's moanin'  she's cryin' like a child  you can hear her if you listen  above the roar so wild  is she cryin' for the ones who lie  within her molten sides?  or cryin' for herself  i'm a-wonderin'  but the livin' soon were rescued  the ones who lived to tell  from the star they watched her  as she died there in the swells  like a toy ship on a mill pond  she burned all through the night  then slipped beneath the waves in the mornin'   oh  when he was a man  my father would stand  i never saw him run  there wasn't anyone could make the man bend  the strength of his will was the tool of his trade  and he did his work well  till the powers that be took a liking to him  and they traded his body for a cold empty shell  don't beat me down  don't beat me down  i've got something to say  don't you stand in my way  and don't beat me down  oh  when i was a youth  i found the truth  in the eyes of a friend  there wasn't anyone could make the light dim  and we talked and we rambled and we gambled to win  and the learning was good  till the powers that be to a liking to him  they traded their fortunes for the sight of his blood  when i was a child and my mother smiled  at the cradle she bought  for the little tot she held to her breast  and the song that she sang was an anthem to love  it was all that i heard  till the powers that be took a liking to me  and they told me that love was a four-letter word  don't beat me down  don't beat me down  i've got one life to live  and that's all i can give  so don't beat me down  and now i've got a place  i got a worried face  and a question in mind  please let me find a reason somehow  why some reap the harvest while other men die  and the joker runs wild  and if powers that be take a liking to us  then we all must return to the ways of a child  we all must return to the ways of a child  so don't beat me down  don't beat me down  i've got something to say  don't you stand in my way  and don't beat me down  i've got one life to life  and that's all i can give  so don't beat me down  don't beat me down  don't beat me down   i looked into a windowpane  last evening in a city far away  i was feelin' sad and blue  i wondered then if i should really stay  wanting someone to be with me in the light of this uncertain time  waiting by the window for the man inside  to please make up his mind  will you be one who passed through but never saw  never knowing never feeling anything  will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do  will you be one who passed through but never saw  i walked along the roadway to a fountain  where lovers come to meet  a hobo walked up to me  i could tell  he didn't have enough to eat  he said  "good sir you look so kind  and though the years have stripped me to the bone  it seems i am the better man  for in this place i've never walked alone  will you be one who passed through but never saw  never knowing never feeling anything  will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do  will you be one who passed through but never saw  "where will you be  my friendly  when your  telephone ain't givin' out no calls  and when the seasons come to haunt you  will you still find springtime in the fall  and when you're on your island  will you wave at every ship that passes by  and will you feed a hungry man  i thank you  sir   now i'll just say goodbye"  don't you be one who passed through but never saw  never knowing never feeling anything  will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do  will you be one who passed through but never saw  will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do  will you be one who passed through but never saw   that long thin dawn  that long thin dawn is coming on again  i've seen the hills of frisco and the streets of montreal  in every town i've been to i've had someone to call  from winnipeg to edmonton  vancouver to st. paul  i've had so many good friends i couldn't miss them all  in that long thin dawn  that long thin dawn is coming on again  last night i came to denver beneath the snowcapped ridge  i thought about my darling as i stood beneath the bridge  and there were times i made her cry but i guess by now she's learned  that any time i've wandered i always have returned  in that long thin dawn  that long thin dawn is coming on again  right now i'm on a highway just east of omaha  riding shotgun on the biggest rig you ever saw  with forty tons of pig iron and a trucker known as bill  all the way to windsor  we've got some miles to kill  in that long thin dawn  that long thin dawn is coming on again  while climbing up a hillside  bill drops her down a gear  and the engine sings so sweetly 'tis music to my ear  i tell him how i long to be just like him if i can  driving like the restless wind across this precious land  in that long thin dawn  that long thin dawn is coming on again  says bill  "the air is clean tonight"  as he puffs a big cigar  "and if this rig keeps rolling  my boy you'll travel far  but when you are a trucker you'll come to realize  the only thing a man can do is watch the world go by"  in that long thin dawn  that long thin dawn is coming on again  that long thin dawn  that long thin dawn is coming on again   from the railhead to the boatyard  from the factory to the farm  from the mine to the mill yard  i've weathered the storm  from the bar room to the bedpost  i've wasted my days  all i have is my drink  and the time left to think  while time slips away  just look at my face  when you tell me goodbye  you'll see what i'm after  by the look in my eye  just walk away and leave me alone  it's a long way back home  now in case you should ask me  what it is that i've done  i'd say i'm a soldier  who once had a son  but my son doesn't know me  that's his right to choose  oh say  can you see? my best friend is me  i'm a friend i could use  just look at my face  when you tell me goodbye  you'll see what i'm after  by the look in my eye  just walk away and leave me alone  it's a long way back home  now the pages have faded  the story grows cold  and the plot falls to ashes  like the ruins of old  those rats in my rafters  they're after my shoes  and anything else they can find on the shelf  i've said they could use  and just look at my face  when you tell me goodbye  you'll see what i'm after  by the look in my eye  just walk away and leave me alone  it's a long way back home  it's a long way back home   all is well  i've made my peace where highways never end  yesterday's a memory today is just a friend  for the mountains and marian are calling me again  and the red pines will bow their heads  the rivers and the watersheds will swallow up my tears  all is well  i left the cold midwestern towns behind  there's a semi up the road ahead i'll take him in my time  for the hot-blooded mountain love is calling me again  and the vagabond within me cries  the wind and rain might burn my eyes but i won't feel the pain  for the mountains and marian will greet me there as only she can do    all is well  as i swing up to the border bent for hell  and the service station man agreed i didn't look too well  but the mountains and marian are calling out to me  and i got my bedroll on my back  and everything that i could pack to see me on my way    all is well  i've made my peace and man  i'm feelin' fine  and the losers that i left behind i'll think about some other time  for the border men were all my friends they couldn't find a dime  and the prairie towns go sailing by  saskatchewan there's mud in your eye i'm leavin' you behind  there'll be hot-blooded mountain love to satisfy my soul  and the red pines will bow their heads  the rivers and the watersheds will carry us along  and the mountains and marian will greet me there as only she can do    all is well  the foothills are coming into sight  today is just a memory the future is tonight  and the red pines will bow their heads  the rivers and the watersheds will carry us along  and the mountains and marian will greet me there as only she can do gonna buy me a long white robe  yes lord to help me home  i'm gonna buy me a long white robe  yes lord to get me home  and when i get my heavenly gown

missin'  i looked across the river to the city  where the windows all stood glistenin'  i stood listenin'  into a tunnel i did rise  like a grave inside  but i was young and able  when i came out the other end  ah through the smoke  the winter light was feeble  unreadable  i was optimistic though  a cabbie told me where to go  i thanked him  a face of white  a face of brown  ah here a smile and there a look of danger  for a stranger  it was too unreal for me  i found no one who trusted me  there was no man could offer me  a cold hand from new york  cold hands from new york  a voice within you cries  "won't someone please help me  i'll do the same for you one day  if you should ever pass my way and need me"  i came down to live alone in new york  the city of the living  there were fortunes at my feet but most of men  were taking  none we giving  or forgiving  children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways  i saw them  there were men who lived in style and others who had died  where no one knew them  beause they couldn't win  there were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms  where babies crept unwanted  till i began to ask myself if there were hope  or if it mattered what they did  or if they lived  it was too unreal for me  i found no one who trusted me  there was no man could offer me  a cold hand from new york  cold hands from new york  a voice within you cries  "won't someone please help me  i'll do the same for you one day  if you should ever pass my way and need me"  i came down through albany to new york  to find what i'd been missin'  i looked across the river to the city  where the windows all stood glistenin'  i stood listenin'  and there were prophets in the squares  and people there who smiled and said  "forget it"  there were lovers in the park  and there was danger in the dark  i felt it  so afraid of it  and there were preachers of the word and poets  who were never heard  i heard them  there were those who would not try to learn  the measure of the lie they're livin'  i heard a young musician play in a place  where they paid you not to listen  i heard a woman scream for help while men stood by  and offered their best wishes  that's how it is  it was too unreal for me  i found no one who trusted me  there was no man could offer me  a cold hand from new york  cold hands from new york  a voice within you cries  "won't someone please help me  i'll do the same for you one day  if you should ever pass my way and need me"  cold hands from new york  a voice within you cries  "won't someone please help me  i'll do the same for you one day  if you should ever pass my way and need me"  cold hands from new york  a voice within you cries  "won't someone please help me  i'll do the same for you one day  if you should ever pass my way and need me"   when first i did appear upon this native soil  all up and down this country at labor i did toil  i slumbered in the moonlight and i rose with the sun  i rambled through the canyons where the cold rivers run    when first i did come down where the land meets the sea  the people said who are you and what would your name be  i said i have no home and i am no man's son  'twas inland i was born and from inland that i come    in the good land i was young and i was strong  no one dared to call me son  happy just to see my day's work done  see my day's work done    so i swung an axe as a timberjack  and i worked the quebec mines  and on the golden prairie i rode the big combines  i sailed the maritime waters of many a seaport town  built the highways and the byways to the western salmon grounds    i've gazed upon the good times i've seen the bad times too  felt many a cold and bitter wind and many a mornin' dew  i've watched the country growin' like a fair and mighty thing  and on the still of a summer night i've heard the mountains ring    in the good land i was young and i was strong  no one dared to call me son  happy just to see my day's work done  see my day's work done    but now the seeds are planted and the gates are open wide  the old ways are forgotten there's no place left to hide  and the legacy i'm leavin' you is not very hard to find  you'll see it all around you at this crossroads of time  in the sweet soil it's a-growin' at the crossroads of time oh the neon lights were flashin'  and the icy wind did blow  the water seeped into his shoes  and the drizzle turned to snow  his eyes were red  his hopes were dead  and the wine was runnin' low  and the old man came home  from the forest    his tears fell on the sidewalk  as he stumbled in the street  a dozen faces stopped to stare  but no one stopped to speak  for his castle was a hallway  and the bottle was his friend  and the old man stumbled in  from the forest    up a dark and dingy staircase  the old man made his way  his ragged coat around him  as upon his cot he lay  and he wondered how it happened  that he ended up this way  getting lost like a fool  in the forest    and as he lay there sleeping  a vision did appear  upon his mantle shining  a face of one so dear  who had loved him in the springtime  of a long-forgotten year  when the wildflowers did bloom  in the forest    she touched his grizzled fingers  and she called him by his name  and then he heard the joyful sound  of children at their games  in an old house on a hillside  in some forgotten town  where the river runs down  from the forest    with a mighty roar the big jets soar  above the canyon streets  and the con men con but life goes on  for the city never sleeps  and to an old forgotten soldier  the dawn will come no more  for the old man has come home  from the forest now have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock  for the ship marie christine and all her

of girl you'd like to see  in a movie or a rosary    she could be straight-laced or homespun  or free and easy on the run  she could be meek and mild or full of fun    she liked country lanes and aeroplanes  and cigarettes would make her strange  and when she wanted you she made it plain    she would never say where she came from  it didn't seem that she had anyone  to answer to or dwell upon    she liked candlelight and good wine  and i would call her any time  of day or night she didn't mind    the was nothing that i wouldn't do  to prove to her my love was true  and she gave to me a dream or two    there were times when she would never appear  for days and then she'd disappear  but now the days have turned to years    i was something she could use  like a good friend or a pair of shoes  or any kind of good news    now the eastern sky is crimson and red  as i lie here in my lonely bed  and think about the things she said    she said darling there will come a day  when i must run far away  i will go my love and you must stay    she departed in the early spring  she didn't leave me anything  to follow or to find her    she was something very special to me  the kind of girl

 that i knew and a big harvest moon  that shon' by suppertime in the dusty afternoon    and i need to be there  when the autumn wind goes whistlin' through the trestle we would climb  like brave mountaineers  we never were much bothered by time    born in the country and i like that country song  we played for just a nickel every time we got to town  and i bought you a dime diamond ring  in the hayloft we would play  we were princesses and kings    and i need to be there  when the world gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind  like brave mountaineers  we never were much bothered by time    born in the country and i like that country way  of the uncles and the cousins and the card games they would play  while the young ones slept overhead  beneath the quilts that mother made  when all the prayers were said    and i need to be there  when the autumn wind goes whistlin' through the trestle we would climb  like brave mountaineers  we never were much bothered by time    and i need to be there  when the world gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind  like brave mountaineers  we never were much bothered by time there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run  when the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun  long before the white man and long before the wheel  when the green dark forest was too silent to be real    but time has no beginnings and hist'ry has no bounds  as to this verdant country they came from all around  they sailed upon her waterways and they walked the forests tall  and they built the mines the mills and the factories for the good of us  all    and when the young man's fancy was turnin' to the spring  the railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring  their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day  and many a fortune lost and won and many a debt to pay    for they looked in the future and what did they see  they saw an iron road runnin' from sea to the sea  bringin' the

to take.    i walk away like a movie star  who gets burned in a three way script.  enter number two   a movie queen to play the scene  of bringing all the good things out in me   but for now love lets be real.    i never thought i could act this way  and i've got to say that i just don't get it.  i don't know where we went wrong  but the feelings gone and i just can't get it back.    if you could

was a mighty good man  cause he played 'til the break of dawn  he ups and downs about four more rounds  and he stayed 'til the crowd went home  it seemed to me like he never could be  like anything i'd ever seen before  when he stepped from the stage  with his ax in his hand  and he run through the backstage door    i'd do it again  i'd do it again  i'd do it again    a one man band on a one

seem different somehow  it's for better or worse  it's for people who thirst  for a love that burns brighter right now    and it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone  and if children had wings i would sing them this song  with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye  everything will be fine by and by    there were things that were said  there were things that were done  and a wife cannot stand too much pain  and what i thought was best  couldn't please her much less  but my love still goes on  that don't change    and it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone  and if children had wings i would sing them this song  with a smile on my lips and a tear in my eye  everything will be fine by and by    and it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone  and if children had wings i would sing them this song  with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye  everything will be fine by and by    and it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone  and if children had wings i would sing

love and maple syrup goes together  like the sticky winds of winter when they meet  when lonely lovers come to rest  beneath the trees they do their best  but still they can't be free  looking for the world to be  anything but what they see  longing to be understood  by the heart that shapes the wood    if you go into the forest  gaze up through the leaves  and see the sky that's almost wild  you must learn to understand  what makes the forest greet the man  like a mother's only child    in the north when when winter's claw  relaxes now to keep the laws of nature in control  people come and stand in line  to rob the forest of her wine  but they don't feel the cold    looking for the world to be  anything but what they see  longing to be understood  by the heart that shapes the wood    love and maple syrup goes together  like the sticky winds of winter when they meet  when lonely lovers come to rest  beneath the trees they do their best  but still they can't be free    love and maple syrup shine like  embers warm  like thoughts divine  they tell us it is spring  love and maple syrup stir  the thoughts of people into words  of songs that they can sing    looking for the world to be  anything but what they see  longing to be understood  by the heart that shapes the wood the minstrel of the dawn is here  to make you laugh and bend your ear  up the steps you'll hear him climb

across the room into your mind they go  listen to the strings  they jangle and dangle  while the old guitar rings    the minstrel of the dawn is gone  i hope he'll call before too long  and if you meet him you must be  the victim of his minstrelsy  he'll sing for you a song  the minstrel of the dawn the oceans of the world were the home of big blue  he was the greatest monster that the world ever knew  and the place that he loved best  was the waters to the west  around the blue pacific he did roam    big blue moved alone for a mighty blue was he  and the battles of the whales was an awesome sight to see  and he took them one by one and he drove them all away  in the mating of the day he was the king    big blue had fifty wives and he sired forty sons  though most of them feel victim to the cruel harpoon guns  ah but he was too much wise to get caught by the gunners' eyes  and so he lived at sea a hundred years    his mouth was as large as a tunnel so they say  his hide was thick as leather and his eyes quick and small  and his back was all scarred by the times he got away  and he knew the smell of whalers did big blue    big blue passed away to his natural decay  beside the arctic circle as he travelled up that way  and there never was a man who was born with a gunner's hand  who ever took a pan to big blue    now the gray whale has run and the sperm is almost done  the finbacks and the greenland rights have all passed and gone  they've been taken by the men for the money they could spend  and the killing never ends  it just goes on    the oceans of the earth were the home of big blue  he was the greatest monster that the world ever knew  and the place that he loved best was the waters to the west  around the blue pacific he did roam try to understand  i'm

way  did she mention my name    did she mention my name just in passing  and when the morning came  do you remember if she dropped a name or two  is the home team still on fire  do they still win all the games  and by the way  did she mention my name    is the landlord still a loser  do his signs hang in the hall  are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall  does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame  and by the way  did she mention my name    did she mention my name just in passing  and when the talk ran high  did the look in her eye seem far away  is the old roof still leaking when the late snow turns to rain  and by the way  did she mention my name    did she mention my name just in passing  and looking at the rain  do you remember if she dropped a name or two  won't you say hello from someone  they'll be no need to explain  and by the way  did she mention my name listen up and i'll tell you what you'll do  forget about music and alcohol too

on the other side  you wanna know the reason why  she arrives at promises and you believe in what she says  everywhere you go  is the light of passion burnin' bright?  everywhere you go  only love would know  you think  you've been wronged again  oh what a way to treat a friend  she belongs to other eyes and surely you must realize  she ain't the kind who would soon step aside  pay any dues at the expense of her pride  everywhere she goes  only love would know  in the days gone by i came to believe  everything is trust  all the rest is dust  mother nature  mother dear  listen to us over here  are the sounds of laughter ringing true?  only love would know  only love would do  she lives on another plane away from the drivin' rain  she says no  you say yes  and that's how it should be i guess  only love would know  may the light of love surround you tonight  everywhere you go  only love would know  you think  you were wrong until  you learned once and for all it's still  one more lesson on the way  or that is what it seemed to say  she's not the kind who would soon step down  not the kind you would try to walk around  when only a thought would go very well  you can tell by the touch  ah but only love would know  passion burnin' bright  tears of passion late at night  is the light of passion burning bright?  everywhere you go  only love would know   ah  the living ain't easy  with all of these false emotions  too little devotion and i'm tired of just  being alone  she's not the same  she's a son of a gun  she's a red hot flame  she lights the sun and conjures up the rain    like any good gambler  i was chained to a wishing well  i keep wishing in vain  but listen friend  don't look now  she's right behind you  looking for someone to take her inside  it thrills her so  it's a rainbow ride    i'm a little uneasy  and there ain't much pride inside me  she don't know how it hurts and i'm telling you  it's too late now  she's not the same  she's a red hot kid  she's a crying shame    anytime is the right time  to get on with a new tomorrow  but i could never let yesterday go  and when the falling rain makes me sad  she comes to me in the dreams i've had  in the morning light  in the dead of night    ah  the loving ain't easy  i let it get the best of me  she don't know how it hurts and i'm telling you  it's too late now  she don't talk no more  she don't make me feel like she did before  there's too much wait and too much give and take    i'm a little uneasy  and there ain't much pride inside me  she don't know how it hurts and i'm telling you  it's too late now  she's not the same  it's too late now  she's not the same  it's too late now  she's not the same is there someone i can believe in?  is there somewhere i can hide?  take me out of the

carmela was strong on his mind  because of the life he had chosen carmela had left then behind  too long he'd been a bandito carmela had left him alone  but today someone brought a message she'd be seen in old san antone  cross the brazos at waco ride on and i make it by dawn  cross the brazos at waco i'm safe when i reach san antone    he glanced back over his shoulder the posse were nowhere in sight  he'd sent for carmela to meet him at the banks of the brazos tonight  she was waiting and he kept the promise he'd made such a long time ago  as he dropped the guns that she hated in the mighty brazos below  cross the brazos at waco ride on and i make it by dawn  cross the brazos at waco i'll walk straight in old san antone    then the night came alight with gun fire he knew that at last he'd been found  as the ranger's band shoot brightly and bandito laid on the ground  carmela knew he was dying that all of her dreams were in vain  as she kissed his lips for the last time she heard him whisper again  cross the brazos at waco ride on and i make it by dawn  cross the brazos at waco i'm safe when i reach san antone    i'm safe when i reach san antone it was early in the fall and a blowin' up a squall  from the trestle you could hear the weirdest moans  with a mighty lonesome cry came a whistle from the sky  and it chilled the very marrow in my bones    then a loud rushing roar like you never heard before  turned the blood to icy water in my veins  as i watched with rising fear something strange was drawing near  and i saw in the clouds ghost trains     ghost trains ghost trains what a fearful sight   the cannonball and no 9 were racing through the night  just as they passed me by i heard the engineer cry  giver her coal give her coal shovel it on    you could see the fireman grinnin' in the engine that was winnin'  but i knew before the finish they'd be gone   well he knew before the finish they'd be gone   you could see the drivers roll as they shoveled on the coal    and the black smoke came pouring from the stacks  as they thundered through the sky i am here to testify  you could hear the wheel a clickin' on the tracks  through the smoke and the steam you could see the headlights gleam    now i have no proof but still the fact remains  you may doubt it but i swear there were cinders in my hair  when i saw in the clouds ghost trains   ghost trains ghost trains...    as i watched i saw them fade into the dawn   as he watched he saw them fade into the dawn  well the wind blows cold in new york city along about the middle of now  and i'm telling you i'd be a happy man if i could get away somehow  cause i'm growing old before my time finally i see the light  but if it costs a dime to get around the world i couldn't get out of sight  but if i ever get back to georgia there'll be no messin' around  if i ever get back to georgia i'm gonna nail my feet to the ground  [ guitar ]  well the buildings here in new york city grow so doggone tall  sometimes you can walk for a couple of days and never see the sun at all  so i left last night i was homeward bound now i wanna sit and i cry  cause i stuck out my thumb till my thumb got numb and the cars went right onby  but if i ever get back to georgia...  [ piano ]  well i guess my time in new york city hasn't been a total waste  cause i met a little girl from a social world and really put her in her place  when she sold me half of the brooklyn bridge i hung around just for spite  and i played this part till i won her heart and i bought the other half lastnight  but if i ever get back to georgia...       in the days of noah before the lord   when the wicked had all forgotten god  brother noah  built a boat  which above  god's wrath did float    and the people saw that they were made of mud  as the doors swang open and gang plank standing out.  noah and his family entered with a shout.  as the scorners stretched their necks     noah stepped out on the deck  saying  i'm so glad i'm on the inside looking out.      oh i'd rather be on the inside looking out  than to be on the outside looking in  when the rain began to fall  sinners on the  lord did call  the door was shut and night was setting in.  then old noah from the window looking out  gazed to heaven beyond the water spout.  and he said i thank the lord that i took him  at his word.  i'm so glad i'm on the inside looking out.    good old daniel lived in babylon long ago  and he had the grace to tell the devil no.  though he prayed three times a day in the  good old fashioned way.    they said he  to the lions den must go.  and lions made him welcomed to their home  for they knew he was nothing but backbone  when the king looked in and said  "are you    alive or are you dead?"  he was stirred as daniel spoke in gentle tones. i was totin' my pack along  the dusty

just a plain mother  and bill was just a usual dad  and they had their little family quarrels   like everybody else   but neither one really got mad    then one day something happened  it was nothing of course  but one word led to another  and the last word led to a divorce    now here were two grown up people  who failed to use common sense  they strengthened their own selfish pride  at little sue's expense    you know she didn't ask to be brought to  this world  to drift from pillar to post  but a divorce never stops to consider  the ones it hurts the most    there'd be a lot more honest loving  in this wicked ole world today  if just a few parted parents  could hear little sue say    take me and lead me and hold to my hand  oh heavenly father  help me understand i know there's never

opened up the underworld to the ones we loved so well  so tell me gentlemen is it right to send her to a cell    if she drinks while you taught her and if she smokes you showed her how  so gentlemen do you think it's right to condemn her now  and when you're in that jury room just remember there and then  that for every fallen woman there's a hundred fallen men  and before you render a verdict on what this girl has done    just remember there's a man to blame and that man might be your son  now gentlemen that's my story my testimony stands  this girl is my own daughter and the case is in your hands  those broadway roses and prevalent sounds at too many parties and too manypalsshould you go first and i remain to walk the road alone  i'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known  in spring i'll wait for roses red  when fades the lilacs bloom  and in early fall when brown leaves fall  i'll catch a glimpse of you  should you go first and i remain  for battles to be fought  each thing you've touched along the way  will be a hallowed spot  i'll hear your voice i'll see your smile though blindly i may grope  the memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope  beyond the sunset  oh blissful morning  when with our savior  heaven is begun  earth's toiling ended  oh glory dawning  beyond the sunset when day is done  should you go first and i remain  to finish with the scroll  no lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll  we've known so much of happiness  we've had our cup of joy  and memory is one gift of god that death cannot destroy  i want to know each step you take that i may walk the same  for someday down that lonely road  you'll hear me call your name  should you go first and i remain  one thing i'll have you do  walk slowly down that long long path  for soon i'll follow you  in that fair homeland  we'll know no parting  beyond the sunset for ever more   written by ernest tubb 1941. rec. by e. t. 11-17-41  key ddemo recorded by hank williams  probably 1949.     d  now i've been married about six months   only six  d7  months you  g  see   the  a7  first three months  was all ok   but the last three is killin  d  me   my wife began her hissin  cut down on her kissin   and then she failed to  d7  shine my  g  shoes   my  a7  shirts they came up wrinkled   my pants with dirt were sprinkled   and then i took the first year  d  blues.     d  well then she started naggin   she left the sink asaggin   with dishes  d7  piled up  g  high   no  a7  food upon the table  she said if she was able   shed cook something bye and  d  bye   then i began to wonder  if i had made a blunder   when i  d7  said i  g  do  she  a7  must have read my thinkin   her eyes began to blinkin and that gal broke in - d  - to.     d  well i heard the dishes crashin   and i began to dashin  gettin  d7  out of  g  sight   for  a7  right there was my honey   on who i'd spent my money  turnin into dy - na -  d  - mite   then after she'd exploded  her meanness all unloaded   and things began to  d7  simmer  g  down   i  a7  found myself ableedin  and very much aneedin   of stitches taken all a -  d  - round.     d  well then she started cryin  i felt myself asighin   and then i took her  d7  in my  g  arms   i  a7  was afraid to scold her  so i just gently told her   she didn't do a bit of  d  harm   now the first six months is over  and i am much the older   and experienced  d7  with a  g  wife   if  a7  i can stand the next six  my friends all say i'll be fixed   to take it the rest of my  d  life. i've just been to heaven with someone so true  i dreamed about mama last night  she read me the bible like she used to do  i dreamed about mama last night    she never close her eyes and sleep till we were all in bed  and on party nights till we came home she often sat and read  we little thought about it then for we were young and gay  just how much mama worried when we children were away    we only knew she never slept when we were out at night  that she waited just to know that we'd all come home alright  why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three  it seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key    for always when we'd step aside she'd call and we'd reply  but we were all too young back then to understand the reason why  until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light  for mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight    she had to know that we were safe before she went to rest  well she seemed to fear that the world might harm  the ones that she loved the best  and once she told me when you're grown to women and to men  perhaps i'll sleep the whole night through i may be different then    and so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care  that always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' there  then came the night that we were called together round her bed  the children are all with you now the kindly doctor said    and in her eyes the gleam again that old time tender light  that told that she's just been waitin' to know we were alright  she smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to god to keep  her children safe from harm throughout the years  and then she went to sleep    my dream is a treasure that i'll always keep  i dreamed about mama last night when i agree with you baby it makes you mad  and when i don't  it makes you sad  when i argue back you pack and leave  and when i don't you pout in grieve  there just ain't nobody knows what i go through  will you please make up your mind  what you want me to do?  you say get out and i'd better stay gone  then you have a big policeman drag me back home  you holler good and loud put him in the calaboose  then you cry and ask the judge  ?won't you please turn him loose??  the good lord only knows what i go through  will you please make up your mind  what you want me to do?  my life with you baby has been one hard knock  lord  my head looks like an old chop block  and i'll tell you right now honey that ain't all  you done kicked me till i feel like a used football  there just ain't nobody knows what i go through  will you please make up your mind  what you want me to do?  you knock me down and then you pick me up  honey do you have to love so doggone rough  i wish to my soul you'd slow down the pace  'cause i tell you right now the hide's gettin' scarce  there just ain't nobody knows what i go through  will you please make up your mind  what you want me to do?  why when i married you  you were such a meek little thing  but honey among tigers  you'd be queen  if a poor little rabbit had you on his side  every hound in the country would crawl off and hide  there just ain't nobody knows what i go through  will you please make up your mind?  what in the confounded cat hair  you want me to do?  did you ever hear the story of the christmas tree?  who just didn't want to change the show  he liked living in the woods and playing with squirrels  he liked bicycles and snow  he liked wolves and eagles and grizzly bears  and critters and creatures that crawled  why bugs were some of his very best friends  spiders and ants and all  now that's not to say that he ever looked down  on a vision of twinkled lights  or on mirrored bubbles and peppermint canes  and a thousand other delights  and he often had dreams of tiny reindeer  and a jolly old man in a sleigh  full of toys and presents and wonderful things  and a story of christmas day  oh  alfie believed in christmas alright  he was full of christmas cheer  all of each and every day  and all throughout the year  to him it was more than a special time  much more than a special day  it was more than a beautiful story  it was a special kind of way  you see some folks have never heard a jingle bell ring  and they've never heard of santa claus  they've never heard the story of the son of god  and that made alfie pause  did that mean that they'd never know of peace on earth  or the brotherhood of man  or know how to love  or know how to give  if they can't  no one can  you see  life is a very special kind of thing  not just for a chosen few  but for each and every living  breathing thing  not just me and you  so when you're at christmas prayers this year  alfie asked me if i'd ask you  say a prayer for the wind and the water and the wood  and those who live there too   i came into this lovely city about three weeks ago today   and i've been trying to find someone that i can talk to  a friendly face toturn my way.  i walk these streets in silent sorrow  i walk my feet into the ground   and all i see are cloudy  cold  suspicious faces  i swear to god it brings medown.  is there no one with a smile for me  no one with a hello in their eyes?  is there no one who will love me and help me through the dark and lonelynight?    the park's so green and full of flowers and lovers lying on the lawn.  i wish i had a lady here that i could laugh with  sweet jesus christ  it hurtsme so to be alone.  is there no one with a smile for me  no one with a hello in their eyes?  is there no one who will love me and help me through the dark and lonelynight?    singing la la la la la la  singing la la la la la la.    this life is hard and full of trouble  it's painful just to live from day today.  but if you're weary and afraid don't turn away now   there's no reason why we have to feel this way.  is there no one with a smile for me  no one with a hello in their eyes?  is there no one who will love me and help me through the dark and lonelynight?    singing la la la la la la  singing la la la la la la.    i just need someone to talk to. it hurts to be alone.  i just need someone to laugh with. it hurts to be alone.  i just want someone to love me. i need someone to talk to. and it hurts to bealone.    singing la la la la la la  singing la la la la la la.  singing la la la la la la  singing la la la la la la. in my mind i'm gone to carolina  can't you

it's a long  long way home    josie spends the evening with the people in the pages  of the paperback she picked up in the store  or sometimes it's the tv or she'll try to write a letter  but they don't come too often anymore    it's a hard life living when you're lonely  it's a long night sleeping alone  it's a hard time waiting for tomorrow  it's a long  long way home    and i stare at the gray walls before me  and i see her face in the stone  and i try to imagine our baby  and i wish they would let me go home  and i wish they would let me go home  and i wish they would let me go home    it's a hard life living when you're lonely  and i wish they would let me go home  it's a long night sleeping alone  and i wish they would let me go home  it's a hard time waiting for tomorrow  and i

woman in love   tall pine trees are pointing us easily to heaven above.  blue spruce flaming on the grate in the evening  takes the chill away fine   cut the telephone line  the story's the same.  there's a worn red chair by the window that she found at a sale down the way   when some old woman said that they needed more room for the winter.  people like pulling out the stuffing when they sit down  so it passes thetime   cut the telephone line  the story's the same.    ooh  like a bubble on a windy day start to flutter when i hear you say   that you feel too good to go away and you make me feel fine.  and you made the world a warmer place  by the sparkle of your diamond face.  on a gray spot  put a little lace and you make me feel fine   warm as a mountain sunshine  on the edge of a snowline  in a meadow ofcolumbine.    oh  little jennifer  i'd give a penny for what you've got on your mind   seems like most of the time you're lying there dreaming.  maybe in your vision you see how our mission is  slightly less than defined   cut the telephone line  the story's the same.  now rippling waters flow through the ceiling and the walls and they're keepingme warm  and the closest i've been to my family for days is my music.  but to silently stare in the morning sky is like hearing her calling my name   cut the telephone line  the story's the same.    ooh  like a bubble on a windy day  start to flutter when i hear you say   that you feel too good to go away and you make me feel fine.  warm as a mountain sunshine  on the edge of a snowline  in a meadow ofcolumbine. see the sun rise  open up your eyes  today is the very first day  watch the morning come  now the night is gone  yesterday is so very far away  trouble  you get out of my sight  you know i can't look at you when the sun is so bright  you know everything's coming together now  can't you see    and i live my life in cel-e-bra-tion  that i've got a life to live  and i sing my song in rev-e-la-tion  that i've got a song that i can give to you  and you know i do    la la la la la la la la  la la la la la la la la  la la la la la la la la la  la la la la la la la la  la la la la la la la la  la la la la

 that i've got a life to live  and i sing my song in rev-e-la-tion  that i've got a song that i can give to you  and you know i do and you know it's true.    la la la la la la la la  la la la la la la i've been out on this highway now  five days in a row  my words all run together  my feet are moving slow  i've got to stop and eat  while it's still light  there's a local angel sitting on my right  do you believe in love at first sight  baby  you look good to me tonight    i'm ordinarily very shy  and i'd be polite if i had time  baby  you look good to me tonight  tomorrow  i'll be good and gone  please don't make me wait that long  baby  you look good to me tonight    i get off at eleven  she said  and walked away  she poured a cup of coffee and  she brought it on a tray  she said  "it would be nice if you could stay  you're the best idea i've had all day."  usually i put up a fight but  baby  you look good to me tonight.    well i'm ordinarily very shy  but i grinned at her as i ate my pie  baby  you look good to me tonight  i thought i must be in a dream  when she asked me if i wanted cream  baby  you look good to me tonight    all in all you know  it's not a bad life on the road  if you've got wheels to roll  and lucky stars above  your destiny's your own  you go as far as you can go  and if there's time to sleep  there's time to make love    i came  i saw  i conquered  but i rode off in the sun  but i know the look she left with me  keeps telling me she won  her face is the only thing i see  whispering those words of prophesy    i may come easy  but i don't come free  you're never gonna see the last of me  baby  you look good to me tonight  i was born to love you now can't you see  baby  you look good to me tonight  i'm ordinarily very shy  but i take the time to satisfy  baby  you look good to me tonight to sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean   to ride on the crest of a wild raging storm  to work in the service of life and living   in search of the answers of questions unknown  to be part of the movement and part of the growing   part of beginning to understand     aye calypso the places you've been to   the things that you've shown us   the stories you tell  aye calypso  i sing to your spirit   the men who have served you so long and so well    hi dee ay-ee ooo doo-dle oh  oo do do do do do doo-dle ay yee  doo-dle ay ee    like the dolphin who guides you  you bring us beside you  to light up the darkness and show us the way  for though we are strangers in your silent world  to live on the land we must learn from the sea  to be true as the tide and free as a wind swell  joyful and loving in letting it be    aye calypso the places you've been to   the things that you've shown us   the stories you tell  aye calypso  i sing to

casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walkin'  down the stairway to the subway in the shadows down below  following their footsteps through the neon darkened coridors  of silent desperation  never speakin' to a soul    the poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dyin'  'cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain  but casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes  of the clickin' of the turnstile and the rattle of his chains    "oh"  she said "casey it's been so long since i've seen you"  "here" she said  "just a kiss to make a body smile"  "see" she said  "i've put on new stockings just to please you"  "lord" she said  "casey can you only stay awhile"    casey leaves the underground and stops inside the golden crown  for somethin' wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones  see'ing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men  who reach for anything they can to keep from going home    standing in the corner  casey drinks his pint of bitter   never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by  then he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason  is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye    "oh" she said  "i suppose you seldom think about me"  "now" she said  "now that you've a family of your own"  "still" she said  "it's so blessed good to feel your body"  "lord" she said  "casey  it's a shame to be alone"    "oh" she said  "casey  it's been so long since i've seen you"  "here" she said "just a kiss to make a body smile"  "see" she said  "i've put on new stockings just to please you"  "lord" she said  "casey  can you only stay a while"  "lord" she said  "casey it's a shame to be alone" this song appears on nine albums  and was first released on the farewellandromeda  this is john

eyes  the stars are fading quietly  the night is nearly gone  and so you turn away from me  and tears begin to come    and it's goodbye again  i'm sorry to be leavin' you  goodbye again  as if you didn't know  it's goodbye again  and i wish you could tell me  why do we always fight when i have to leave    it seems a shame to leave you now  the days are soft and warm  i long to lay me down again  to hold you in my arms  i long to kiss the tears away  give you back the smile  other voices beckon me  to go a little while    and it's goodbye again  i'm sorry to be leavin' you  goodbye again  as if you didn't know  it's goodbye again  and i wish you could tell me  why do we always fight when i have to leave    have to go and see some friends of mine  some that i don't know  some who aren't familiar with my name   it's something that's inside of me not hard to understand  it's anyone who listens to me sing    and if your hours are empty now  who am i to blame  you think if i were always here  our love would be the same  as it is the time we have  is worth the time alone  and lying by your side  the greatest peace i've ever known    but it's goodbye again  i'm sorry to be leavin' you  goodbye again  as if you didn't know  it's goodbye again  and i wish you could tell me  why do we always fight when i have to leave the prodigal son  he'd been away awhile  he was workin' his way back home now  over many a ragged mile  when he finally crossed the river  and his father saw him near  there was a joyful sound for all the world to hear  i listened to what the good book said  and it made good sense to me  talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'  people tryin' to be free  now we got new names and faces  this time around  gospel changes  lord  still goin' down  jesus  he did not doubt his gift  though he knew that he had not long to live  he took care of the business  teaching us how to fly  then he bowed his head  and laid down to die  i listened to what the good book said  and it made good sense to me  talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'  and people tryin' to be free  now we got new names and faces  this time around  gospel changes  lord  still goin' down  jerusalem  i see is standin' high  but if you lose your salvation  there'll be no tears left to cry  now some men worship a golden calf  while others are bought and sold  and if we live like that

boy just up off the floor  we used to go down to grandma's house every month end or so  we'd have chicken pie  country ham  homemade butter on the bread  but the best darn thing about grandma's house  was the great big feather bed    it was nine feet high and six feet wide  and soft as a downy chick  it was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese  took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick    it could hold eight kids and four hound dogs  and a piggy we stole from the shed  we didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun  on grandma's feather bed    after supper we'd sit around the fire  the old folks'd spit and chew  pa would talk about the farm and the war  and granny'd sing a ballad or two  and i'd sit and listen and watch the fire till the cobwebs filled my head  next thing i'd know i'd wake up in the morning  in the middle of the old feather bed    it was nine feet high and six feet wide  and soft as a downy chick  it was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese  took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick    it could hold eight kids and four hound dogs  and a piggy we stole from the shed  we didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun  on grandma's feather bed    well  i love my ma and i love my pa  i love granny and grandpa too  i've been fishin' with my uncles  i wrestled my cousin  i even kissed aunt lou  ew!  but if i ever had to make a choice i guess it oughta be said  that i'd trade them all plus the gal down the road  for grandma's feather bed    it was nine feet high and six feet wide  and soft as a downy chick  it was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese  took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick    it could hold eight kids and four hound dogs  and a piggy we stole from the shed  we didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun  on grandma's feather bed  we didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun  on grandma's feather bed  lady's chains   jessie went away last summer  a couple of months ago.  after all our time together  it was hard to see her go.  she called me right up when she arrived  asked me one more time to come   but living on an la freeway ain't my kind of having fun.  i think i'd rather be a cowboy  i think i'd rather ride the range.  i think i'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.    when we were just beginning  it was such an easy way.  laying back up in the mountains making love for sunny days.  she got tired of picking daisies and cooking my meals for me   she can live the life she wants to  yes  it's all right with me.  i think i'd rather be a cowboy  i think i'd rather ride the range.  i think i'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.    i'd rather live on the side of a mountain than wander through canyons ofconcrete and steel.  i'd rather laugh in the rain and sunshine and lay down my sundown in somestarry field.    oh  but i miss her in the morning when i awake alone.  the absence of her laughter is a cold and empty sound.  but her memory always makes me smile and i want you to know   i love her  yes i love her just enough to let her go.  i think i'd rather be a cowboy  i think i'd rather ride the range.  i think i'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.  i think i'd rather be a cowboy  i think i'd rather ride the range.  i think i'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains. there's lonely hearts in arkansas  there's truckers in des moines  all there to keep me company in the early morn  a world unknown to daytime  is forever going on  the airways of the

could fly away  when i think that i'm moving  suddenly things stand still  i'm afraid 'cause i think they always will    and i'm looking for space  and to find out who i am  and i'm looking to know and understand  it's a sweet  sweet dream  sometimes i'm almost there  sometimes i fly like an eagle  and sometimes i'm deep in despair    all alone in the universe  sometimes that's how it seems  i get lost in the sadness and the screams  then i look in the center  suddenly everything's clear  i find myself in the sunshine and my dreams    and i'm looking for space  and to find out who i am  and i'm looking to know and understand  it's a sweet  sweet dream  sometimes i'm almost there  sometimes i fly like an eagle  and sometimes i'm deep in despair    on the road of experience  join in the

sweet dream  sometimes i'm almost there  sometimes i fly like an eagle  but sometimes i'm deep in despair  sometimes i fly like an eagle   like an eagle  i go flying flying had an uncle named matthew  he was his father's only boy  born just south of cobly  kansas  he was his mother's pride and joy      yes  and joy was just the thing that he was raised on  love is just the way to live and die  gold is just a windy kansas wheat-field  and blue is just a kansas summer sky    and all the stories that he told me  back when i was just a lad  all the memories that he gave me  all the good times that he had    growin' up a kansas farmboy  life was mostly havin' fun  ridin' on his daddy's shoulders  behind a view beneath the sun        well  i guess there were some hard times  and i'm told some years were lean  they had a storm in forty-seven  a twister came and stripped them clean    he lost the farm and lost his family  he lost the wheat and lost his home  but he found a family bible  faith as solid as a stone        so he came to live at our house  and he came to work the land  he came to ease my daddy's burden  and he came to be my friend    so  i wrote this down for matthew  and it's for him the song is sung  ridin' on his daddy's shoulders  behind a mule beneath the sun    [chorus x 2] this song was first released on the live at the sydney opera house album.  it is the only album it has been released on.    one sunday morning as i was walking  by brisbane waters i chance to stray  i heard a convict his fait bewhaling  as on the sunny riverbank he lay    i am a native of erin  ireland  but banished now from my native shore  they stole me from my independence  and from the maiden whom i do adore    i've been a prisoner at port macquarie  at norfolk island and emu plains  at castle ule and curstune garbby  at all these settlements i've been enchained    but of all places of condemnation  and penal stations in new south wales  to moreton bay i have found no equal  excessive tyranny each day prevails    for three long years i was beastly treated  and heavy irons on my legs i wore  my back from flogging was lacerated  and oft times covered with my crimson gore    and many a man from downright starvation  lies smouldering now beneath the cave  and captain logan he had us mangled  on the triangles of moreton bay    like the egyptians and ancient hebrews  we were oppressed under logan's yoh  till a native black lying bare and ambush  did deal out tyrant with his mortal stroke    my fellow prisoners be exhilerated  let all such monsters like death shall find  and when from bondage we're extricated  our former suffering shall will fade from mind    one sunday morning as i was walking  by brisbane waters i chance to stray  i heard a convict his fait bewhaling  as on the sunny riverbank he lay i've been lately thinking  about my life's time  all the things i've done  and how it's been  and i can't help believing  in my own mind  i know i'm gonna hate to see it end    i've seen a lot of sunshine  slept out in the rain  spent a night or two all on my own  i've known my lady's pleasures  had myself some friends  and spent a time or two all on my own    and i have to say it now  it's been a good life all in all  it's really fine  to have a chance to hang around  and lie there by the fire  and watch the evening tire  while all my friends and my old lady  sit and pass the pipe around    and talk of poems and prayers and promises  and things that we believe in  how sweet it is to love someone  how right it is to care  how long it's been since yesterday  and what about tomorrow  and what about our dreams  and all the memories we share    the days they pass so quickly now  nights are seldom long  and time around me whispers when it's cold  the changes somehow frighten me  still i have to smile  it turns me on to think of growing old  for though my life's been good to me  there's still so much to do  so many things my mind has never known  i'd like to raise a family  i'd like to sail away  and dance across the mountains on the moon    i have to say it now  it's been a good life all in all  it's really fine  to have the chance to hang around  and lie there by the fire  and watch the evening tire  while all my friends and my old lady  sit and pass the pipe around    and talk of poems and prayers and promises  and things that we believe in  how sweet it is to love someone  how right it is to care  how long it's been since yesterday  what about tomorrow  what about our dreams  and all the memories we sharelife in the city gets all closed in  when you stand in a crowd all alone  wishing that someone would call out your number  hoping that someone might phone    nights in the city can drive you crazy  there's so very much going on  try to get quiet  you'll miss out on something  like someone who's looking for  someone who's looking...    there  i almost got caught again  lost in the night all alone  with nowhere to hide  crying inside  a wild heart looking for home    sleeping without you is always cold  the nights are so dark and so long  dreaming of touching your face in the moonlight  filling the silence with song    living without you the days are endless  the clock winding steadily down  imagining footsteps  your hand at the gatepost  the wind shuts the open door  the wind shuts the open...  there  i almost got caught again  lost in the night all alone  with nowhere to hide  crying inside  a wild heart looking for home    the songbird  she trembles all day long  she sings as if her poor heart must break  watching the freedom that flies past her window  dreaming won't fit in a cage    fly away songbird  the wind she loves you  your prison is forsaken at last  follow your dreaming  you're bound up to heaven  you're reaching for something more  reaching for something...    there  i almost got caught again  lost in the night all alone  with nowhere to hide  crying inside  a wild heart looking for home    there  i thought of your face again  a vision to have and to hold  my spirit still sings  i'm flying again  a wild heart looking for home  a wild heart looking for home there's a tenderness that i feel  it's very real you see  i can feel your body stir so deep within  let it be an out of love tonight completely  and let me ask of you one thing    don't close your eyes tonight  just look at me and see how many times i cried for you  don't close your eyes tonight  let it be me  not just a fantasy  let it be me tonight    well you can lie so close to someone and still feel alone  and though i heard you say you loved me so many times  while you give me love so beautiful and tender  someone else is in your mind    don't close your eyes tonight  just look at me and see how many times i cried for you  don't close your eyes tonight  let it be me  not just a fantasy  let it be me tonight    sorry if i cry - feelings run so deep  many is a time when i'll wake up and find  that i'm crying in my sleep  look me in the eye  tell me what you see  i'm the one who loves you  i'm the one who needs you  make this one for me    don't close youe eyes tonight  just look at me and see how many times i cried for you  don't close your eyes tonight  let it be me  not just a fantasy  let it be me tonight well i guess that you probably know by now  i was one who wanted to fly  i wanted to ride on that arrow of fire right up into heaven  and i wanted to go for every man  every child  every mother of children  i wanted to carry the dreams of all people right up to the stars    and i prayed that i'd find an answer there  or maybe i would find a song  giving a voice to all of the hearts that cannot be heard  and for all of the ones who live in fear  and all of those who stand apart  my being there would bring us a little step closer together    they were flying for me  they were flying for everyone  they were trying to see a brighter day for each and everyone    they gave us their light  they gave us their spirit and all they could be  they were flying for me  they were flying for me    and i wanted to wish upon the milky way  and dance upon a falling star  i wanted to give myself and free myself  and join myself with it all    given the chance to dream  it can be done  the promise of tomorrow is real  children of spaceship earth  the future belongs to us all    she was flying for me  she was flying for everyone  she was trying to see a brighter day for each and everyone    she gave us her light  she gave us her spirit and all she can be  she was flying for me  they were flying for me  they were flying for everyone  they were trying to see a brighter day for each and everyone    they gave us their light  they gave us their spirit and all they can be  they were flying for me  they were flying for me  they were flying for me  they were flying for me hey there  mr. lonely heart  if you could find the time  i would like to sit and talk  to see if we could find  the answer to the mystery of love's most precious seed  is it in a touch or in a kiss or simply in the need    or is it really love itself that always wants to give  the heart and soul of all of us and everything that lives    hey there  mr. cold  cold heart  i know i could be wrong  to think that life could be so sweet and love could be so strong  as to gather everyone of us  like one big family  to share with one another all we have and all we see    it's true the deepest part of us is everywhere the same  and that the only differences are really just the names    we can join the children's song and show them that we care  let them know we're on their side  no matter when or where  we can free their hearts from fear and hunger reconcile  we can give a child a chance and give a child a smile    true love is still the answer  and we are still the way  the gift is in the giving  and in living what we say    and if you have a lonely heart  this song is just for you  to ask for all that you can give and all that you can do  remember that the mystery of love's most precious seed    is in the heart of all of us  true love is all we need  it's in the heart of all of us  true love is all we need  within the heart of all of us  true love is all we need    within the heart of all of us  true love is all we need  within the heart of all of us  true love is all we need  within the heart of all of us  true love is all we need  within the heart of all of us  true love is all we need lost in a boat on the ocean  lost in a ship out at sea  lost in the dark of misfortune  where is a light i can see  where is a light i can see  where is the highway to heaven  where is the love we all need  where is the peace that we long for  where is the man who is free    here in the heart there is freedom  here in the heart there is peace  here in the heart is the answer  to questions much deeper than these    you've got to hold on tightly  let go lightly  it's only surrender  it's all in the game  if you just hold on tightly  let go lightly  there's always forgiveness and no one to blame    some will take fame over fortune  some will take love over gold  some will pray only for power  some never want to grow old  some see the day that is coming  some only see what has passed  someone will always be first in line  someone will always be last    here in the heart there is freedom  here in the heart there is peace  here in the heart is the answer  to questions much deeper than these    you've got to hold on tightly  let go lightly  it's only surrender  it's all in the game  if you just hold on tightly  let go lightly  there's always forgiveness and no one to blame there ain't nothin' in the world that i like better  than bacon 'n lettuce 'n home grown tomatoes  up in the morning  out in the garden  get you a ripe one  don't get a hard 'un    plant 'em in the spring  eat 'em in the summer  all winter without 'em is a culinary bummer  i forget all about the

doubt  after all of those nights alone  all those desperate mornings  never a doubt  there was never a doubt in my mind    i suppose there have been times when you felt like a room filled with darkness  not a window around  there must have been moments you felt you were truly alone  then again each of us knows  in a night of unbearable sadness  still a light can be found  in each morning the promise that someday your true love will come    i suppose there are some people who never believe in the magic  oh the magic of love  they think nothing is precious and life is just pleasure and pain  then again each of us knows  when a heart has been broken it's tragic  oh the magic of love  even that which is broken with love can be mended again    all the things that you fear  at the most they mean nothing  all the sorrow and sadness can just disappear    there was never a doubt  never a doubt in my mind  we weren't meant to be lonely  never a doubt i knew that i'd find you some day  there was never a doubt  after all of those nights alone  all those desperate mornings  never a doubt  there was never a doubt in my mind  there was never a doubt in my mind  never a doubt in my mind yesterday i had a dream about dying  about laying to rest and then flying  how the moment at hand  is the only thing we really own  and i lay in my bed and i wonder  after all has been said and is done for  why is it thus we are here  and so soon we are gone    is this life just a path  to the place that we all have come from  does the heart know the way  and if not can it ever be found  in a smile or a tear  or a prayer or a sigh or a song    and if so i sing for my father  and in truth you must know i would rather  he were here by my side  we could fly on the wings of a dream  to a place where the spirit could find us  and joy and surrender would bind us  we are one anyway  anyway we are more than we seem    there are those who will lead us  protect us each step of the way  from beginning to end  for each moment forever each day  such a gift has been given  it can never be taken away    though the body in passing must leave us  there is one who remains to receive us  there are those in this life  who are friends from our heavenly home  so i listen to the voices inside me  for i know they are there just to guide me  and my faith will proclaim it is so  we are never alone    from the life to the light  from the dark of the night to the dawn  he is so in my heart  he is here he could never be gone  though the singer is silent  there still is the truth of the song    yesterday i had a dream about dying  about laying to rest and then flying  how the moment at hand  is the only thing we really own    and i lay in my bed and i wonder  after all has been said and is done for  why is it thus we are here  and so soon we are gone  why is it thus we are here  and so soon we are gone african sunrise  shine on a brand new day  african sunrise  show us a brand new way  give us a brand new morning  show us forever beginning to stand on our own  african sunrise  smile on my african home    in this hour of quiet contemplation  the stillness of the dawning calms my mind  i face the day with heartfelt exaltation  the light is both a promise and a sign    in the darkness we have lost the son of our sister  though the beauty of his spirit lingers still  this was a child of love  a child of laughter  who cannot understand the way i feel    is it not the sun that gives the seasons  is it not the sun that brings the rain  our throats are choled with dust  but we're still singing  our song will not be silenced by the rain    all around the village i could hear the roosters crowing  there was a time it was like music to my ears  now all i can hear is the sound of hungry babies crying  i pray for rain to wash away their tears    african sunrise  light of a brand new day  african sunrise  light of a brand new way  with one who will be our brother  and one who will be our partner and teach us to know    african sunrise  smile on my african home  african sunrise...  african sunrise... when i was a child and i lived in the city  i dreamed of alaska so far away  and i dreamed i was flying over mountains and glaciers  somehow i knew that i'd live there one day    well it took me some growin' and a fair bit of schoolin'  and a little bit of trouble to get on the move  and i felt like a loser but i turned out the winner  when i came to alaska the land that i love    here's to alaska  here's to the people  here's to the wild and here's to the free  here's to my life in a chosen country  here's to alaska and me.    i was born in a cabin on little mulchatna  raised in hard times but i had a good life  from the first time i flew with my father a singin'  i knew that i'd wind up a bush pilot's wife.    we sleep near the sound of a slow running river  and wake up most mornings to a drizzling rain  and we live every day like the first or the last one  with nothing to lose and heaven to gain.    here's to alaska  here's to the people  here's to the wild and here's to the free  here's to my life in a chosen country  here's to alaska and me.    oh  for a fire on a cold winter's night  once more to gaze at the great northern lights  for all of the beauty my children will see  here's to alaska and me.    here's to alaska  here's to the people  here's to the wild and here's to the free  here's to my life in a chosen country  here's to alaska and me  oh  here's to alaska and me i caught a ride on the dreamland express last night  i was sailing on an ocean of blue  and right there by my side  much to my surprise  was you    i said  come on over baby  let me look in your eyes  let me see the very heart of you  and i couldn't believe it  or conceive that my dream would come true    'cause you said  hey there sweet daddy  everything is alright  you know for miles there's not a telephone line  there's not a soul to disturb us  just come and be mine    you said  let me be the end of your rainbow  let me be the stars up above  let me be the one that you long for baby  let me be the one that you love  oh  let me be the one that you love    but now it's four in the mornin'  i can't sleep  i can't seem to get you out of my mind  i keep tossin' and turnin'  i'm yearnin' for the sun to shine    i'd like to send you a ticket on the dreamland express  and take you far away with me  i've got a vision of heaven  you livin' there with me    let me be the end of your rainbow  let me be the stars up above  let me be the one that you long for baby  let me be the one that you love  oh  oh  let me be the one that you love    let me be the end of your rainbow  let me be the stars up above  let me be the one that you long for baby  let me be the one that you love  oh  let me be the one that you love this is what it's like falling out of love  this is the way you lose your very best friend  this is how it feels when it's all over  this is just the way true love ends    first of all there's no one to talk to  when there is they just don't seem to hear  words don't seem to matter much anyway  they can't describe the pain  they can't explain the fear    then the nights grow cold and hard to live through  still you hate to see the morning come  somehow tomorrow doesn't matter much anymore  the future holds no promise  your life's already done    this is what it's like falling out of love  this is the way you lose your very best friend  this is how it feels when it's all over  this is just the way true love ends    the you find your heart no longer flutters  you no longer look through a lover's eyes  what's to see when the world falls down around you  you simply can't believe it  but it comes as no surprise    this is what it's like falling out of love  this is the way you lose your very best friend  this is how it feels when it's all over  this is just the way true love ends    what's the sense of failure  it's such an incredible loss  it's all the things you'll never do  and all the dreams that will never come true    this is what it's like falling out of love  this is the way you lose your very best friend  this is how it feels when it's all over  this is just the way true love ends  oh this is just the way a true love ends  i don't believe a true love ever ends life is just too short for some folks  for other folks it just drags on  some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey  others figure tea's too strong    well  i'm the type of guy who wants to ride the middle  i don't like

conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail  all along a southbound odyssey  the train pulls out of kankakee  rolls along past houses  farms and fields  passin' towns that have no name  freight yards full of old black men  the graveyards of the rusted automobiles    singing good morning america  how are you?  saying  don't you know me i'm your native son?  i'm the train they call the city of new orleans  i'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done    dealing cards with the old men in the club car  penny a point  ain't no one keeping score  pass the paper bag that holds the bottle  feel the wheels a rumbling beneath the floor    and the sons of pullman porters  and the sons of engineers  ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel  and mothers with their babes asleep  rockin' to the gentle beat  and the rhythm of the rails is all they feel  singing good morning america  how are you?  saying don't you know me  i'm your native son?  i'm the train they call the city of new orleans  i'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done    night time on the city of new orleans  changing cars in memphis  tennessee  halfway home and we'll be there by morning  through the mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea  but all the towns and people seem  to fade into a bad dream  and the steel rails still ain't heard the news  the conductor sings his song again  the passengers will please refrain  this train has got the disappearing railroad blues    singing good morning america  how are you?  saying don't you know me  i'm your native son?  i'm the train they call the city of new orleans  i'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done played a wedding for the money and i wish i could have told the bride andgroom  just what i think of marriage  what's in store after the honeymoon.  i was rumbling through the verses about how men and women ought to live apart   how a promise never made could not be broken and would never break a heart.    suddenly from out of nowhere this little girl came spinning across the floor  her crinolines were billowing beneath the skirt of calico she wore.  as her joy fell on the honored guests each one of them was drawn into herdream  and they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands and hollered at her dance little jean!    they said:  dance little jean  this day is for you   two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'  dance little jean  the prayer that you had was answered today-  your momma's marrying your dad.    well this cynic's heart just melted as i figured what this get together meant  and how it ended years of tears and sad confusions that the little girl hadspent.  they told the band to pack it up about the time the couple cut the cake  but we stayed and we played all night long for love and laughs and littlejeanie's sake    we played:  dance little jean  this day is for you   two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'  dance little jean  the prayer that you had was answered today-  your momma's marrying your dad.    we sang:  dance little jean  this day is for you   two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'  dance little jean  the prayer that you had was answered today-  your momma's marrying your dad.   horses are creatures who worship the earth  they gallop on feet of ivory  constrained by the wonder of dying and birth  the horses still run they are free  my body is

went to sleep    all she ever talked about was getting on to ride  she was living in another time you could see it in her eyes  and every day after school she'd head down to the track  waiting for the train that was never coming back    jenny dreamed of trains  when the nighttime came  nobody knew how she made it come true  jenny dreamed of trains    the depot's been boarded up  the rails have turned to rust  there hasn't been a train through here since the mill went bust  no one believed her when she said she heard the train  said she was just a little girl acting kind of strange    jenny dreamed of trains  when the nighttime came  nobody knew how she made it come true  jenny dreamed of trains    jenny laid a penny on the track one day  in god we trust she walked away  the very next

'cause after all  hell man  it's christmas.    away in a manger no crib for a bed.  the little lord jesus lay down his sweet head.  the stars in the sky look down where he lay.  the little lord jesus asleep on the  1-2  hay.    merry christmas everybody. she was a level-headed dancer on the road to alcohol  and i was just a soldier on my way to montreal  well she pressed her chest against me  about the time the juke box broke  yeah  she gave me a peck on the back of the neck  and these are the words she spoke      blow up your t.v. throw away your paper  go to the country  build you a home  plant a little garden  eat a lot of peaches  try an find jesus on your own    well  i sat there at the table and i acted real naive  for i knew that topless lady had something up her sleeve  well  she danced around the bar room and she did the hoochy-coo  yeah she sang her song all night long  tellin' me what to do        well  i was young and hungry and about to leave that place  when just as i was leavin'  well she looked me in the face  i said "you must know the answer."  "she said  "no but i'll give it a try."  and to this very day we've been livin' our way  and here is the reason why    we blew up our t.v. threw away our paper  went to the country  built us a home

restaurant  for something to do  the waitress yelled at me  so did the food  and the water taste funny  when you're far from your home  but it's only the thirsty  that hunger to roam  and the clock

mountain time  by rocky mountain time   i wish  i hope  i wonder  where you're at sometimes  is your back against the wall?  or just across the line  have you been standing in the rain  reciting nursery rhymes?  trying to recall  some long lost kind of peace of mind  peace of mind  try spending the night sometime  all alone in a frozen room  afterneath you've lain  your saddle in the rain    i dreamed they locked god up  down in my basement  and he waited there for me  to have this accident  so he could drink my wine  and eat me like a sacrament  and i just stood there like i do  then i came and went  i came and went  like a bird in a foreign sky  couldn't even say good bye  or come and share the pain  my saddle's in the rain    i saw a friend who doesn't know  if i'm his friend just yet  his eyes and mouth were widely open  and his jaw was set  like he'd fell off a cliff  and hadn't hit the bottom yet  i wish he wouldn't pull those things on me  without a net  without a net  i had him up to the house one time  and we was having a real good time  then he went and lain  his saddle in the rain    in a laundromat not too far  from the alamo  sits a girl who stole my records  very long ago  and she wishes  wants and washes  out those dirty clothes  as she shuts her eyes and dreams  about her one eyed joe  one eyed joe  car parked on a dirty road  heaven knows the load she pulled  couldn't take the strain  a saddle in the rain sam stone came home   to the wife and family  after serving in the conflict overseas.  and the time that he served   had shattered all his nerves   and left a little shrapnel in his knees.  but the morhpine eased the pain   and the grass grew round his brain   and gave him all the confidence he lacked   with a purple heart and a monkey on his back.    there's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes   jesus christ died for nothin i suppose.  little pitchers have big ears   don't stop to count the years   sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.    sam stone's welcome home  didn't last too long.  he went to work when he'd spent his last dime  and soon he took to stealing  when he got that empty feeling  for a hundred dollar habit without overtime.  and the gold roared through his veins  like a thousand railroad trains   and eased his mind in the hours that he chose   while the kids ran around wearin' other peoples' clothes...    there's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes   jesus christ died for nothin i suppose.  little pitchers have big ears   don't stop to count the years   sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.    sam stone was alone  when he popped his last balloon   climbing walls while sitting in a chair.  well  he played his last request   while the room smelled just like death   with an overdose hovering in the air.  but life had lost it's fun   there was nothing to be done   but trade his house that he bought on the gi bill   for a flag-draped casket on a local hero's hill.    there's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes   jesus christ died for nothin i suppose.  little pitchers have big ears   don't stop to count the years   sweet songs never last too long on broken radios. like a bolt of lightning  like a bolt of thunder  like a cloudy day  down at the zoo  like a drowning man that will never go under  that close to you  yeah  that close to

well she lived in an aluminum house trailer  and she worked in a juke box saloon  and she spent all the money that i give her  just to see the old man in the moon  i used to sleep at the foot of old glory  and awake in the dawn's early light  but much to my surprise when i opened my eyes  i was a victim of the great compromise  well we'd go out on saturday evenings  to the drive-in on route 41  and it was there that i first suspected  that she was doin' what she'd already done  she said  "johnny won't you get me some popcorn"  and she knew i had to walk pretty far  and as soon as i passed through the moonlight  she hopped into a foreign sports car  i used to sleep at the foot of old glory  and awake in the dawn's early light  but much to my surprise when i opened my eyes  i was a victim of the great compromise  well you know i could have beat up that fellow  but it was her that had hopped into his car  many times i'd fought to protect her  but this time she was goin' too far  now some folks they call me a coward  'cause i left her at the drive-in that night  but i'd rather have names thrown at me  than to fight for a thing that ain't right  i used to sleep at the foot of old glory  and awake in the dawn's early light  but much to my surprise when i opened my eyes  i was a victim of the great compromise  now she writes all the fellows love letters  saying "greetings  come and see me real soon"  and they go and line up in the barroom  and spend the night in that sick woman's room  but sometimes i get awful lonesome  and i wish she was my girl instead  but she won't let me live with her  and she makes me live in my head  i used to sleep at the foot of old glory  and awake in the dawn's early light  but much to my surprise when i opened my eyes  i was a victim of the great compromise   well  i rocked over italy and i rocked over spain  i rocked in memphis it was all the same  till i rocked to africa and rolled off ship.  and seen them natives doing a odd

played the music on the radio  mama rocked the baby to sleep  he said  he would've taken the other road  but he didn't think the lake was that deep  well  if the ferry had been there at the end of the pier  we'd be half way to uncle jake's  instead of looking at fish out the window  i wish  we'd hit the bottom of the bottomless lake  'stead of looking at fish out the window  i wish  we'd hit the bottom of the bottomless lake  we are falling down  down to the bottom of a hole in the ground  smoke 'em if you got 'em  i'm so scared  i can hardly breathe  i may never see my sweetheart again  so if you're ever goin' on a big trip  you better be careful out there  start everything on your good foot  wear clean underwear  take along a bible in the backseat  read of david and solomon  for if you make a mistake in the bottomless lake  you may never see your sweetheart again  if you should make a mistake in the bottomless lake  you may never see your sweetheart again  if you should make a mistake in the bottomless lake  you may never see your sweetheart again  that's right  jesus  the missing years    it was raining. it was cold  west bethlehem was no place for a twelve year old  so he packed his bags and he headed out  to find out what the world's about  he went to france. he went to spain  he found love. he found pain.  he found stores so he started to shop  but he had no money so he got in trouble with a cop  kids in trouble with the cops  from israel didn't have no home  so he cut his hair and moved to rome  it was there he met his irish bride  and they rented a flat on the lower east side of rome...  italy that is  music publishers  book binders  bible belters  money changers   spoon benders and lots of pretty italian chicks.      charley bought some popcorn  billy bought a car  someone almost bought the farm  but they didn't go that far  things shut down at midnight  at least around here they do  cause we all reside down the block  inside at  23 skidoo.    wine was flowing so were beers  so jesus found his missing years  so he went to a dance and said "this don't move me"  he hiked up his pants and he went to a movie  on his thirteenth birthday he saw "rebel without a cause"  he went straight on home and invented santa claus  who gave him a gift and he responded in kind  he gave the gift of love and went out of his mind  you see him and the wife wasn't getting along  so he took out his guitar and he wrote a song  called "the dove of love fell off the perch"  but he couldn't get divorced in the catholic church  at least not back then anyhow  jesus was a good guy he didn't need this shit  so he took a pill with a bag of peanuts and  a coca-cola and he swallowed it.  he discovered the beatles  and he recorded with the stones  once he even opened up a three-way package  in southern california for old george jones        the years went by like sweet little days  with babies crying pork chops and beaujolais  when he woke up he was seventeen  the world was angry. the world was mean.  why the man down the street and the kid on the stoop  all agreed that life stank. all the world smelled like poop  baby poop that is ..the worst kind  so he grew his hair long and thew away his comb  and headed back to jerusalem to find mom  dad and home  but when he got there the cupboard was bare  except for an old black man with a fishing rod  he said "whatcha gonna be when you grow up?"  jesus said "god"  oh my god  what have i gotten myself into?  i'm a human corkscrew and all my wine is blood  they're gonna kill me mama. they don't like me bud.  so jesus went to heaven and he went there awful quick  all them people killed him and he wasn't even sick  so come and gather around me my contemporary peers  and i'll tell you all the story of  jesus  the missing years        we all reside down the block  inside at  23 skidoo. we were standing  standing by peaceful waters  standing by peaceful waters  whoa wah oh wha oh  whoa wah oh wha oh    many years ago along the illinois-wisconsin border  there was this indian tribe  they found two babies in the woods  white babies  one of them was named elizabeth  she was the fairer of the two  while the smaller and more fragile one was named marie  having never seen white girls before  and living on the two lakes known as the twin lakes  they named the larger and more beautiful lake  lake elizabeth  and thus the smaller lake that was hidden from the highway  became known forever as lake marie    repeat chorus:    many years later i found myself talking to this girl  who was standing there with

me that awful name    well  it was gatlinburg in mid-july  and i just hit town and my throat was dry  i thought i'd stop and have myself a brew  at an old saloon on a street of mud  there at a table  dealing stud  sat the dirty  mangy dog that named me sue    well  i knew that snake was my own sweet dad  from a worn-out picture that my mother'd had  and i knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye  he was big and bent and gray and old  and i looked at him and my blood ran cold  and i said  "my name is sue  how do you do  now you're gonna die"     yeah  that's what i told him     well  i hit him hard right between the eyes  and he went down  but to my surprise  he come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear  but i busted a chair right across his teeth  and we crashed through the wall and into the street  kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer    i tell ya  i've fought tougher men  but i really can't remember when  he kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile  i heard him laugh and then i heard him cuss  he went for his gun and i pulled mine first  he stood there lookin' at me and i saw him smile    and he said  "son  this world is rough  and if a man's gonna make it  he's gotta be tough  and i knew i wouldn't be there to help ya along  so i give ya that name and i said goodbye  i knew you'd have to get tough or die  and it's the name that helped to make you strong"    he said  "now you just fought one hell of a fight  and i know you hate me  and you got the right  to kill me now  and i wouldn't blame you if you do  but ya ought to thank me  before i die  for the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye  'cause i'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you sue"    well what could i do? what could i do?  i got all choked up and i threw down my gun  and i called him my paw  and he called me his son  and i came away with a different point of view  and i think about him  now and then  every time i try and every time i win  and if i ever have a son  i think i'm gonna name him..  bill or george! any-damn-thing but sue!    alright  thank you very much oh  i am a cheat and i'm a liar  oh  but you're a lovin' ball of fire  i'll leave

hardin' wouldn't run    he rode in like a texas wind took the eastbound train  goin' goin' with jane bowen till the law men caught up  so long janie chin up i'll be back again    off he went to huntsville prison so long janie he cried  fifteen years she waited till her heart broke and she died  and she left that bad land to wait up in the sky    free at last the payin' past for all the wrong he did  first free air they let him breathe since he was a kid  so let him come and let him go and let him deal and bid    near the border in el paso lawyer reads the sign  you won't find him there for business every day at nine  for business is real bad one client's all he's had in quite a long long time    then sheriff selman's boy broke in to wes's woman's place  up she jumped and pistol whipped him kicked him in the face  and john selman demands revenge for this disgrace    you could see every night by candlelight in hardin's favorite bar  she'd be hanging on his arm and very late they'd leave there  headed for the goose hair glad it wasn't far    right through the swinging doors john selman came with a blazin' gun  wes hardin chug-a-luggin' red eye got him in the back of the head  john wesley hardin fell dead cos hardin wouldn't run on the shores of gitchgoomy by the shining big sea water  hiawatha old and grayin' listened to the older prophet listened to lagu  and the young men and the women from the land of ojibways  from the land of the dakotas from the woodlands and the prairies  stood and listened to the prophet heard lagu tell hiawatha  "i have seen" he said  "a water bigger than the big sea water  broader than the gitchgoomy bitter so that none cold drink it  salty so that none would use it"  hiawatha then spoke to them stopped all their jeering and their jesting  and he spoke to all the people  it's true what lagu tells you for i have seen it in a vision  i have also seen the water to the east to the land of morning  and upon this great water came a strange canoe with pinions  bigger than a grove of pine trees  taller than the tallest tree tops  and upon this great canoe were sails to carry it swiftly  and it carried many people  strange and foreign were these people  and white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered  then said hiawatha  "i beheld a darker vision"  many hundreds came behind them pushed their way across our prairies  in our woodlands rang their axes  in our valleys smoked their cities  our people were all scattered all forgetful of our councils  left their homelands going westward wild and woeful  and the man with bearded faces  the men with skin so fair  with their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people  farther westward  westward  westward then wild wild and wilder  grew the west that once was ours   as long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow  as long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow  the senecas are an indian tribe of the iroquios nation  down on the new york pennsylvania line you'll find their reservation  after the us revolution corn planter was a chief  he told the tribe these men they could trust that was his true belief  he went down to independence hall and there was a treaty signed  that promised peace with the usa and indian rights combined  george washington gave his signature the government gave its hand  they said that now and forever more that this was indian land  as long as the moon shall rise...  on the seneca reservation there is much sadness now  washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how  across the allegheny river they're throwing up a dam  it will flood the indian country a proud day for uncle sam  it has broke the ancient treaty with a politician's grin  it will drown the indians graveyards corn planter can you swim  the earth is mother to the the senecas they're trampling sacred ground  change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down  as long as the moon shall rise...  the iroquios indians used to rule from canada way south  but no one fears the indians now and smiles the liar's mouth  the senecas hired an expert to figure another site  but the great good army engineers said that he had no right  although he showed them another plan and showed them another way  they laughed in his face and said no deal kinuza dam is here to stay  congress turned the indians down brushed off the indians plea  so the senecas have renamed the dam they call it lake perfidy  as long as the moon shall rise...  washington adams and kennedy now hear their pledges ring  the treaties are safe we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling  it's the back water from perfidy lake it's rising all the time  over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine  no boats will sail on lake perfidy in winter it will fill  in summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill  but the government of the usa has corrected george's vow  the father of our country must be wrong what's an indian anyhow  as long as the moon shall rise  look up  as long as the rivers flow  are youthirsty   as long as the sun will shine  my brother are you warm  as long as the grassshall grow early one mornin' while makin' the rounds  i took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down  i went right home and i went to bed  i stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.    got up next mornin' and i grabbed that gun  took a shot of cocaine and away i run  made a good run but i run too slow  they overtook me down in juarez mexico.    laid in the hot joint takin' the pill  in walked a sheriff from jericho hill  he said willy lee your name is not jack brown  you're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.    i said yes sir my name is willie lee  if you've got a warrant just read it to me  shot her down cause she made me slow  i thought i was her daddy but she had five more.    when i was arrested i was dressed in black  they put me on a train and they took me back  had no friends for to go my bail  they slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.    early next morning about a half past nine  i spied a sheriff comin' down the line  coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat  he said come on you dirty hack into that district court    into the court room my trial began  where i was handled by twelve honest men  just before the jury started out  i saw that little judge commence to look about.    in about five minutes in walked a man  holding the verdict in his right hand  the verdict read in the first degree  i hollered lordy lordy have mercy on me    the judge he smiled as he picked up his pen  ninety nine years in the folsom pen  ninety nine years underneath that ground  i can't forget the day i shot that bad bitch down  come on you gotta listen unto me  lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be now i will tell you buster that i ain't a fan of custer  and the general he don't ride well anymore  to some he was a hero but to me his score was zero  and the general he don't ride well anymore  now custer done his fightin' without too much excitin'  and the general he don't ride well anymore  general custer come in pumpin' when the men were out a huntin'  but the general he don't ride well anymore  with victories he was swimmin' he killed children dogs and women  but the general he don't ride well anymore  crazy horse sent out the call to sitting bull and gall  and the general he don't ride well anymore  now custer split his men well he won't do that again  cause the general he don't ride well anymore  twelve thousand warriors waited they were unanticipated  and the general he don't ride well anymore  it's not called an indian victory but a bloody massacre  and the general he don't ride well anymore  there might have been more enthusin' if us indians had been losin'  but the general he don't ride well anymore  general george a.custer oh his yellow hair had lustre  but the general he don't ride well anymore  for now the general's silent he got barbered violent  and the general he don't ride well anymore  oh the general he don't ride well anymore as i walked by the lake one day by chance my dorraine passed my way  then she and i walked hand in hand on the banks of ponchartrain  i pinned a flower on her heart  i swore we'd never be apart  she vowed her love forever and as i kissed her did the same  dorraine  my dorraine  my dark haired little angel  my belle of ponchartrain  we sat down on the dock and with our hearts and fingers locked  we laughed and talked and joked about when our names are the same  and joking i said honey are you marrying me for money  and it took just one quick look to tell it hurt my dear dorraine  she jumped and stood above me and she cried why you don't love me  i'm rowing home across the lake you won't see me again  i called and called some more but she rowed fast from the shore  and the clouds brought by a wind began to rain on ponchartrain  dorraine  i called dorraine  come back my little angel my belle of ponchartrain  the storm should make her learn that she should make a swift return  but as the rain fell harder i lost sight of my dorraine  as panic gripped my heart i drew the oars and made my start  to look for her on raging waters and the rain on ponchartrain  at darkness i still called but no one heard my cries at all  and when the daybreak came then others helped me look for my dorraine  but there was not a thing afloat except the oars from her rowboat  for all was lost upon the choppy waves and rain on ponchartrain  now i come day after day to where my sweetheart rowed away  and i gaze across the water of the rainy ponchartrain  just one thing and nothing more ever floated back to shore  was this flower i hold it is the one i pinned on my dorraine  dorraine  my dorraine  my dark haired little angel  my belle of ponchartrain   i keep hearin' your concern about my happiness  all that thought you've given me is conscience i guess  if i were walkin' in your shoes  i wouldn't worry none  while you and your friends are worryin' 'bout me  i'm havin' lots of fun    countin' flowers on the wall  that don't bother

taking blood pressure  they ask us how we feel  and i always say "fantastic! there ain't nothing wrong with me."  and then they give me my injection and i go right back to sleep  and my days are kind of foggy and my nights are dreamy too  but they're taking good care of me committed to parkview   from the fountains in the mountains  comes the water running cool and clear and blue  and it comes down from the hills  and it goes down to the towns and passes through  when it gets down to the cities  then the water turns into a dirty gray  it's poisoned and polluted  by the people as it goes along its way  don't go near the water children  see the fish all dead upon the shore  don't go near the water  'cause the water isn't water anymore  i took my boy fishin' to my old favorite fishin' hole  i had caught many a fish out of that deep clear water  from the time i was a boy like him  after we'd fished a few minutes  he said  "did you get a bite yet daddy?"  i said  "i think i got a nibble son"  "me too"  he said  then he said  "daddy if we catch a fish can we eat him"  i said  "well there was a time son  this water's bad now and i might not be safe to eat the fish  but there was a time"  there was a time the air was clean  and you could see forever 'cross the plains  the wind was sweet as honey  and no one had ever heard of acid rain  we're torturin' the earth  and pourin' every kind of evil in the sea  we violated nature  and our children have to pay the penalty  don't go near the water children  see the fish all dead upon the shore  don't go near the water  'cause the water isn't water anymore  don't go near the water children  see the fish all dead upon the shore  don't go near the water  'cause the water isn't water anymore   six foot six he stood on the ground   he weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds   but i saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love.  he was the kind of a man that would gamble on luck   look you in the eye and never back up   but i saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love.  you can't see it with your eyes   hold it in your hand.  but like the wind  it covers our land   strong enough to move the heart of any man   this thing called love.  it can lift you up   never let you down   take your world and turn it all around   ever since time  nothing's ever been found   that's stronger than love.  most men are like me  they struggle in doubt   they trouble their minds day in and day out   too busy with living to worry about a little word like love.  but when i see a mother's tenderness   as she holds her young close to her breast   then i thank god that the world's been blessed with a thing called love.  you can't see it with your eyes   hold it in your hand.  but like the wind  it covers our land   strong enough to move the heart of any man   this thing called love.  it can lift you up   never let you down   take your world and turn it all around   ever since time  nothing's ever been found   that's stronger than love.  ever since time  nothing's ever been found   that's stronger than love. every town has its town bum  i guess ours had one  here's a song about him  i remember him fondly  well his name was abner brown  i knew an old drunk named abner brown  and nobody knew when he came to town  but he spread good will to his fellow men  and they let him sleep in the cotton gin  he could drink more brew than an army could  but he had more friends and he did more good  than a lot of fine fancy people in our town  so they tolerated abner brown  and all us kids were on his side  'cause he told us tales till our eyes grew wide  and he made us feel bout ten feet tall  'cause he had no kids but he claimed us all  and after school and on weekends  you could find me down at the cotton gin  the truest friend that i ever found was  a good old drunk named abner brown  abner brown  i wish that i could see you once again  i believe that you'd stack up with all the mighty men

dark and windy day  upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way  when all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw  plowin through the ragid skies and up a cloudy draw    their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel  their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel  a bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky  for he saw the riders comin hard and he heard their mournful cries    chorus:  yippie i ohhh ohh ohh  yippie i aye ye ye  ghost riders in the sky    their faces gaunt  their eyes were blurred  their shirts all soaked with sweat  he's ridin hard to catch that herd  but he ain't caught em yet  cause they got to ride forever in that range up in the sky  on horses snortin fire as they ride on hear their cries    as the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name  ''if you want to save your soul from hell a-ridin on our range  then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride  tryin to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies    yippie i ohhh oh oh  yippie i aye ye ye  ghost riders in the sky  ghost riders in the sky  ghost riders in the sky    joy to the world the lord is come   here was a man a man who was born in a small village the son of a peasantwoman  he grew up in another small village  until he reached the age of thirty he worked as a carpenter    then for three years he was a traveling minister  but he never traveled more than two hundred miles from where he was born  and where he did go he usually walked  he never held political office he never wrote a book never bought a home    never had a family he never went to college and he never set foot inside a bigcity  yes here was a man  though he never did one on the things usually associated with greatness  he had no credentials but himself he had nothing to do with this world    except through the devine purpose that brought him to this world  while he was still a young man the tide of popular opinion turned against him  most of his friends ran away one of them denied him  one of them betrayed him and turned him over to his enemies    then he went through the mockery of a trial  and was nailed to a cross between two thieves  and even while he was dying his executioners gambled  for the only piece of property that he had in this world    and that was his robe his purple robe  when he was dead he was taken down from the cross  and laid in a borrowed grave provided by compassionate friends  more than nineteen centuries have come and gone    and today he's a centerpiece of the human race  our leader in the column to human destiny  i think i'm well within the mark when i say that all of the armies that evermarched  all of the navies that ever sailed the seas    all of the legislative bodies that ever sat and all of the kings that everreigned  all of them put together have not affected the life of man on this earth  so powerfully as that one solitary life  here was a man  joy to the world the lord is come i got a friend named whiskey sam  he was my boonierat buddy for a year in nam  he said is my country just a little off track  took 'em twenty-five years to welcome me back  but  it's

every minority race  with a backstage pass to the willie nelson show  hell's angels blocked the traffic to the building  in order for the beer truck to come through  and waitin' in the wings to sing with willie  were hopeful stars of flickering magnitude  there was a singer willie knew back in the fifties  who once paid him fifty dollars for a song  there were women who once did and some who still would  i heard one ask  "did connie come along?"  and there were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes  and athletes and movie stars and david allan coe  leather and lace and every minority race  with a backstage pass to the willie nelson show  i wish  you could've been there  but maybe you were   a child arrived just the other day  he came to the world in the usual way  but there were planes to catch  and bills to pay  he learned to walk while i was away    and he was talkin' 'fore i knew it and as he grew  he said  i'm gonna be like you  dad  you know i'm gonna be like

and blood need flesh and blood  and you're the one i need  flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  and you're the one i need.    so when this day was ended  i was still not satisfied  for i knew everything i touched  would wither and would die  and love is all that will remain  and grow from all these seeds    mother nature's quite a lady  but you're the one i need  flesh and blood needs flesh and blood  and you're the one i need. well  it's knowin' that your door is always open  and your path is free to walk  that makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up  stashed behind your couch  and it's knowin' i'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds  and the ink stains that have dried upon some lines  that keeps you in the back roads  by the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind  it's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy  planted on their columns now that bind me  or somethin' that somebody said 'cause  they thought we fit together walkin'  it's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'  when i walk along some railroad track and find  that you're movin' on the back roads  by the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind  though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards  and the highways come between us  and some other woman's cryin' to her mother  'cause she turned and i was gone  i still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face  and the summer sun might burn me till i'm blind  but not to where i cannot see  you walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind  i dip my cup of soup  from some gurglin'  cracklin' cauldron in some train yard  my beard a roughenin' coal pile  and a dirty hat pulled low across my face  through cupped hands 'round a tin can  i pretend to hold you to my breast and find  that you're wavin' from the back roads  by the rivers of my memory ever smilin'  ever gentle on my mind   i asked my love to take a walk  take a walk just a little ways  and as we walked  along we talk  all would be our wedding day  and only say that you'll be mine  in no others arms entwined  down beside where the waters flow  down by the banks of the ohio  i asked her if she'd marry me  and my wife forever be  she only turned her head away  and had no other words to say  and only say that you'll be mine  in no others arms entwined  down beside where the waters flow  down by the banks of the ohio  i plunged a knife into her breast  and told her she was going to rest  she cried "oh willy  don't murder me  i'm not prepared for eternity"  i took her by her golden curls  and drug her down to the river side  and there i threw her into drown  and i watched her as she floated down  and only say that you'll be mine  in no others arms entwined  down beside where the waters flow  down by the banks of the ohio  and going home between twelve and one  i cried "oh lord  what have i've done?"  i've killed the only girl i love  because she would not marry me  and only say that you'll be mine  in no others arms entwined  down beside where the waters flow  down by the banks of the ohio   flying cross the desert in a twa  saw a

footsteps  through the neon darkened corridors  of silent desperation  never speakin' to a soul    the poisoned air he's breathin'  has the dirty smell of dyin'  'cause it's never seen the sunshine  and it's never felt the rain    but casey minds the arrows  and ignores the fatal echoes  of the clickin' of the turnstile  and the rattle of his chain    "oh!" she said  "casey it's been so long since i've seen you"  "here" she said  "just a kiss to make a body smile"    "see" she said  "i've put on new stockings just to please you"  "lord" she said  "casey can you only stay a while?"    casey leaves the underground  and stops inside the golden crown  for something wet to wipe away  the chill that's on his bones    seein' his reflection  in the lives of all the lonely men  who reach for anything they can  to keep from goin' home    standing in the corner  casey drinks his pint of bitter  never glancin' in the mirror  at the people passin' by    then he stumbles as he's leavin'  and he wonders if the reason  is the beer that's in his belly  or the tear that's in his eye    "oh!" she said  "i suppose you seldom think about me"  "now" she said  "now that you've a family of your own"    "still" she said  "it's so blessed good to feel your body"  "lord" she said  "casey it's a shame to be alone" there ain't no money to buy cocaine  sugar babe  there ain't no money to buy

door  'cause i've done everything i know to do?  i said  "i don't know just what it is you want from me?"  she said  "i only want us back the way we used to be ?"  then she said    kiss me  kiss me  kiss me  hold me  hold me like you want me  like you'll never let me go?  she said  "show me that you really love me"  and then tell me  'cause i really need to know?  she said  "kiss me  kiss me

want to waste another night?  and somewhere in the darkness there we found a brand new start  as i took every word she whispered straight to heart  when she said    kiss me  kiss me  kiss me  hold me  hold me like you want me  like you'll never let me go?  she said  "show me that you really love me"  and then tell me  'cause i really need to know?  she said  "kiss me  kiss me  kiss me?" she comes in every morning at nine and sits down at her desk  smiles and says hello to everybody and tries to do her best  to act like nothing's wrong and nothing's missin' in her life  but her eyes tell a story  that her smile can't disguise    she's got that needin' somebody  wantin' somebody who  will treat her like somebody for once in her life  she's lonely for love  is that asking too much  for someone to treat her right  she's got that lonely  needin' lovin'  wantin' somebody look in her eyes    sometimes i want to walk on over and tell her i can help  'cause i know losing a love is tough

the signs of a lonely heart  don't you be concerned  there ain't nothin' wrong  it's not her fault  she gets that way when i'm gone    if she's on the floor for a dance or two  don't mean she's lookin' for a rendezvous  she'll only be in his arms  'til the end of the song  there's no harm done  she gets that way when i'm gone    she gets that way but i understand  i know in her heart that i'm her only man  and i can't stand to think of her home all alone    so i really don't mind if she paints the town red  what we feel inside doesn't have to be said  it's a matter of trust  and i know our love is strong  that's why i don't worry none  she gets that way when i'm gone    she gets a little restless but i don't mind  'cause a woman like her  surely deserves to have herself a real good time    so i really don't mind if she paints the town red  what we feel inside doesn't have to be said  it's a matter of trust  and i know our love is strong  that's why i don't worry none  she gets

things true   being drunk's a lot like loving you    'cause i loved till i stumbled   i loved till i fell   when the loving was over it hurt me like hell.  now i what a taste of the wrong love can do   being drunk's a lot like lovin' you    and i've woke up some mornings and sworn off the drink   and  at that i've done reasonably  well i think.  but i haven't done well swearing off you and me  at that i've failed miserably.    well i felt the hangover of loving all night.  i've sat at the bar all alone in a fight.  i've bottled up feelings  and poured them out too   being drunk's a lot like loving you.    and i've woke up some mornings and sworn off the drink   and  at that i've done reasonably  well i think.  but i haven't done well swearing off you and me  at that i've failed miserably.    well i drank till i stumbled   i loved till i fell   when the drunk part was over love hurt me like hell.  now i know about drinkin' so i know one things true   being drunk's a lot like loving you.    though i know what a taste of the wrong love can do   sometimes i still get drunk loving you. i move on like a sinner's prayer  letting go like a levee breaks  walk away as if i don't care  learn to shoulder my mistakes  i'm built to fade like your favorite song  i get reckless when there's no need  laugh as your stories ramble on  break my heart but it won't bleed  my only friends are pirates  it's just who i am  i'm better as a memory than as your man    i'm never sure when the truth won't do  i'm pretty good on a lonely night  i move on the way a storm blows through  i never stay  but then again  i might  i struggle sometimes to find the words  always sure until i doubt  walk a line until it blurs  build the walls too high to climb out  i'm honest to a fault  it's just who i am  i'm better as a memory than as your man    i see you lean in  you're bound to fall  i don't wanna be that mistake  i'm just a dreamer  nothing more  you should know it before it gets too late    'cause good-bye's are like a roulette wheel  you never know where they're gonna land  first you're spinning  then you're standing still  left holding a losing hand  one day you're gonna find someone  right away  you'll know it's true  that all of your seeking's done  was just a part of the passing through  right there in that moment  you'll finally understand  that i was better as a memory than as your man  better as a memory than as your man she was aware of her insecurities  as she took the stage  but she was convinced if she got up there  that she'd be discovered some day  so

picture of my life and my dreams   suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me  well i heard it today and i couldn't help but sing along  'cause every time i hear that song    i go back to a two-toned short bed chevy  drivin' my first love out to the levy  livin' life with no sense of time  and i go back to the feel of a fifty yard line  a blanket  a girl  some raspberry wine  wishin' time would stop right in its tracks  every time i hear that song  i go back  i go back    i used to rock all night long to "keep on rockin' me baby"  at frat parties  college bars  just tryin' to impress the ladies  i heard it today and i couldn't help but sing along  'cause every time i hear that song    i go back to the smell of an old gym floor  and the taste of salt on the carolina shore  after graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends  and i go back to watchin summer fade to fall  growin' up too fast and i do recall  wishin' time would stop right in its tracks  every time i hear that song  i go back  i go back    we all have a song that somehow stamped our lives  takes us to another place and time    so i go back to a pew  preacher and a choir  singin' 'bout god  brimstone  and fire  and the smell of sunday chicken after church  and i go back to the loss of a real good friend  and the sixteen summers i shared with him  now "only the good die young" stops me in my tracks  every time i hear that song  i go back  i go back    to the feel of a fifty yard line  a blanket  a girl  some raspberry wine  i go back  i go back   to watchin' summer fade to fall  growin' up too fast and i do recall  i go back  i go back   to the loss of a real good friend  and the sixteen summers i shared with him  i go back  i go back  i go back we had a dog named bocephus living in the front yard  he liked sleeping out on top of the car  he drank beer out of a mason jar  and he'd climb up on everyone in bed.    a wide frame house in a college town  a bunch of people always hanging around  no real problems we needed to drown  but we tried our best anyway.    we went to class just to pass the time  back in '89.    we had a keg in the closet  pizza on the floor  left over from the night before  where we were going we didn't really care  we had all we ever wanted  in that keg in the closet.    this old guitar taught me how to score  right there on that lambda chi porch  mary ann taught me a little more  about wantin' what you can't have.    sweatshirts and flag football  spring breaks down in panama  for a while we had it all  we never dreamed it wouldn't last.    we went to class just to pass the time  back in '89.    we had a keg in the closet  pizza on the floor  left over from the night before  where we were going we didn't really care  we had all we ever wanted  in that keg in the closet.    we all kind of went our separate ways  but i swear it seems like yesterday.    keg in the closet  pizza on the floor  left over from the night before  where we were going we didn't really care  we had all we ever wanted  in that keg in the closet... i couldn't wait to turn sixteen  and drive all the boys around  foot on the gas and hands on the wheel  was all i could think about    a little rust in the bed of that truck  and a four speed on the floor  five hundred dollars  it was mine all mine  and i never wanted nothing more    i took katie down by the river  with a six dollar bottle of wine  just a fool tryin' to play it cool  hopin' she'd let me cross the line    and i was prayin' that she couldn't tell  i'd never been that far before  the first time's a one time feeling  and i never wanted nothin' more  no i never wanted nothin' more      well  i'm what i am and i'm what i'm not  and i'm sure happy with what i've got  i live to love and laugh a lot  and that's all i need    my buddies all tried to change my mind  but i told them that i thought it through  well katie laughed and my momma cried  when they heard me say i do    her little ring was a little thing  but it was all that i could afford  now shes mine all mine  till the day i die  and i never wanted nothing more  no i never wanted nothing more    well  i'm what i am and i'm what i'm not  and i'm sure happy with what i've got  i live to love and laugh a lot  and that's all i need    one sunday i listened to the preacher  and i knew he was preaching to me  i couldn't help it i walked up front  and i got down on my knee    right then and there i swear  i changed when i found the lord  glory hallelujah good god almighty  i never wanted nothing more  no i never wanted nothing more    well  i'm what i am and i'm what i'm not  and i'm sure happy with what i've got  i live to love and laugh a lot  and that's all i need    i never wanted nothing more  and i never wanted

'cause its the first long kiss on a second date.  momma's all worried when you get home late  and droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate  'cause you're hands are shakin' so much  and its the way that she looks with her eyes and her hair.  eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year  and askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up  yeah man  that's the good stuff.    he grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass.  and i smiled and said i'll have some of that.  we sat there and talked as an hour passed like old friends.  i saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare.  it was a pretty girl with bu-font hair  he said  that's my bonnie  taken 'bout a year after we wed.  he said  i spent five years in the bar when the cancer took her from me.  but i've been sober three years now  'cause the one thing's stronger than the whiskey    was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl  the way she adored that string of pearls  i gave her the day that our youngest boy earl  married his high school love.  and its a new t-shirt sayin' i'm a grandpa.  bein' right there as our time got small  and holdin' her hand when good the lord called her up  yeah man that's the good stuff.    he said  when you get home she'll start to cry.  when she says  i'm sorry  say so am i.  look into those eyes so deep in love and drink it up  'cause that's the good stuff.    that's the good stuff. it was early one morning  playa del carmen  that's when i first met jose  he had a 12 foot schooner  a 3 foot cooler  full of the catch of the day  and he was wrinkled from grinning  from all of the sun he had been in  he was barefoot  cerveza in hand  he said "gracias senor"  when i paid him too much for  all of the snapper he had  now i told him my friend it ain't nothing  in the best broken spanish i knew  i said i make a good living  back home where i'm from  he smiled and said amigo me too    he said i fish and i play my guitar  i laugh at the bar with my friends  i go home to my wife  i pray every night  i can do it all over again    somewhere over texas  i thought of my lexus  and all the stuff i work so hard for  and all the things that i've gathered  from climbing that ladder  didn't make much sense anymore  they say my nest egg ain't ready to hatch yet  they keep holding my feet to the fire  they call it paying the price  so that one day in life  i'll have what i need to retire    and just fish  and play my guitar  and laugh at the bar with my friends  and go home to my wife  and pray every night  i can do it all over again    and to think that i thought for a while there that i had it made  when the truth is i'm really just dying  to live like jose    and just fish  play my guitar  laugh at the bar with my friends  go home to my wife  pray every night  i can do it all over again    wouldn't that be the life?  wouldn't that be the life? ain't nothing out here but me  the road and the radio  looking for an exit and a song that i might know  counting down the memories and adding up the miles  searching for a feeling i ain't felt in a while    clarity and inspiration  happiness is a destination that's hard to find  it may take some time  but in my mind there's something more  and i'll open up a brand new door  and find the strength to close the ones i left behind  and i'll get there leanin' on some friends i know:  the road and the radio    spent the night in carolina  got up early out of bed  bought a red bull and a road map and a old stones cassette  setting my sights south bound  no reason or rhyme  threw up a prayer just lookin'  just lookin' for a sign    and some clarity and inspiration  happiness is a destination that's hard to find  it may take some time  but in my mind there's something more  and i'll open up a brand new door  and find the strength to close the ones i left behind  and i'll get there leanin' on some friends i know:  the road and the radio    in my mind there's something more  and i'll open up a brand new door  and find the strength to close the ones i left behind  and i'll get there leanin' on some friends i know:  the road and the radio  the road and the radio  the road and the radio    mmmm-mmm-mmm ...  the road and the radio  the road and the radio  mmmm-mmm-mmm ... she hit the door 6:55 sack full of groceries split down the side.  can goods scattered all the way to the curb.  look on her face saying don't say a word.  so  it's me and her and a can of beans sitting there on the front porch swing.  western sky all turning red.  head on my shoulder she sighed and said:    been gopherin'  chaufferin'  company chairmen.  coffee maker  copy repairman.  anymore there ain't nothin' i swear man that i don't do.  been juggling  struggling  closing big deals.  dancing backwards in high heels.  just when it feels like i can't make it through.  she said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you    she said the girl i was with the business degree probably wouldn't recognizeme.  i was gonna run the bank.  i was gonna run the map.  now all i want to run is a bubble bath.  back then you know i had this plan.  before all of this reality set in.  here comes life boy ready or not.  hey i wanted it all and that's what i got.

a rastafarian one-man band with songs  that fill my memories like a tip jar  yeah  that's what i see  when i see this bar    i see tourists at christmas time  and i taste beers with a hint of lime  i feel lonely 'cause it's not the same  different faces and different names  living like pirates out among the stars  yeah  that's what i see  when i see this bar    pieces of our past slowly slip away  but time just stands still when i walk in this place    and i see a kid coming into his own  and a man learning to move on  somehow trying to find his way  a dreamer betting on blind faith  chasing that sun and following his heart  yeah  that's what i see  when i see this bar    pieces of our past slowly slip away  but time just stands still when i walk in this place    a few have moved on back to maine  jacksonville and key biscayne  some are still living the dream  stuck in still life it seems  no matter where they've been  or where they are  yeah  i see 'em here  when i see this bar  when i see this bar    i wonder where we go from here   that's what i see when i see this bar   life ain't over but it's always near   that's what i see when i see this bar   i think about all the good times that we had   that's what i see when i see this bar   makes me happy and it makes me sad   that's what i see when i see this bar   how could we be so close  now so far apart   that's what i see when i see this bar   that's what i feel  that's what i see  yeah we were living like pirates and wannabe stars  that's what i see when i see this bar    that's what i see when i see this bar there's still marks on the pantry door of that little house  where mama used to measure us  i'm proud to say that's my home where i was raised  but that ain't where i grew up    see  i gained a little on father time  the summer my granddaddy died  the first time i saw mama cry  man  that sure was tough    felt like i put on a few years  watching daddy wipe her tears  in my little coat and tie standing in that cemetery mud  that's where i grew up    my senior year  a case of beer out on the river bank  getting a head start on twenty one  that's the place that made me feel just like a man  but that ain't where i grew up  no    see i gained a little on father time  that night i crossed that center line  i bet i rolled a dozen times    next thing i knew i was waking up upside down  praying "god  just get me out"  then i hit my knees beside what was left of my truck  hey  that's where i grew up    you learn as you go  that's how you grow    see  i gained a little on father time  when me and her  had our first big fight  i said some things  i made her cry  she packed all her stuff    the boy in me said let her go  but the man in me said pull her close  it was time to find out which one i was  standing in a doorway holding on to love    that's where i grew up  oh  that's where i grew up looks like a roll and a thrift store dress  keeps my heart and her hair a mess  she goes where the wind suggests she goes   who knows?    got a spirit that can't be tamed  she's a calico pony on an open plain  i know i'll never be the same no more   for sure    she's a wild child   got a rebel soul and a whole lot of gypsy  wild style   she can't be tied down  but for a while    you're falling free and so in love  i'll break my heart  but god she drives me  wild child    never heard of her favorite band unless you  been to bono roux or burning man  she's penny lane in a chevy van   she loves to love    she loves me  wild child  got a rebel soul and a whole lot of gypsy  wild style   she can't be tied down  but for a while    you're falling free and so in love  i'll break my heart  but god she drives me  wild child    she'll be here until she runs  some just have to chase the sun    she's a wild child   got a rebel soul and a whole lot of gypsy  wild style   she can't be tied down  but for a while    be falling free and so in love  i'll break my heart  but god she drives me  wild child    a kaleidoscope of colors in her wild shot  a touch of crazy hides behind her wild smile  so simple yet experimental  innocent but still a little wild child  wild childwhen the morning sun streaks across my room  and i've waken up from another dream of you  yes i'm on the road  once again it seems  all i've left behind  is a chain of broken dream    but you know i love you  yes i love you  oh i love you    how i wish that love  is all we need to live  what a life we'd live  'cause i've got so much to give  and it seems so wrong  deep inside my heart  that the dollar sign could be keeping us apart  when you know i love  yes i love you    and if i could only find my way back to the time  when the problems of this life of mine didn't cross our minds  all the answers were found in children's nursery rhymes  i'd come running back to you  i'd come running back to you    but you know we can't live on dreams alone  just to pay the rent  i must leave you all alone  but you know i made me choice many years ago  and this traveling life is the only one i know    but you know  i love you  yes i love you  oh i love you  but you know  i love you  yes i love you  oh i love you    but you know  i love you  yes i love you  oh i love you  but you know  i love you  yes i love you  oh i love you    but you know  i love you  yes i love you  oh i love you  but you know  i love you  yes i love you  oh i love you in a bar in toledo  across from the depot  on a bar stool she took off her ring  i thought i'd get closer  so i walked on over  i sat down and asked her name  when the drinks finally hit her  she said i'm no quitter  but i finally quit livin' on dreams  i'm hungry for laughter  and here ever after  i'm after whatever the other life brings    in the mirror i saw him  and i closely watched him  i thought how he looked out of place  he came to the woman  who sat there beside me  he had a strange look on his face  the big hands were calloused  he looked like a mountain  for a minute i thought i was dead  but he started shakin'  his big heart was breakin'  he turned to the woman and said    you picked a fine time to leave me lucille  with four hungry children  and a crop in the field  i've had some bad times  lived through some sad times  but this time your hurtin' won't heal  you picked a fine time to leave me lucille    after he left us  i ordered more whisky

scarlet's body come alive  let her dance for you and catch your spell  you'll swear you can believe her  be careful not to catch the scarlet fever.  so i paid my fare and walked down front  and found an empty chair  as i settled in young scarlet took the ribbons from her hair  the moves her body made while the music played  were the likes i've never seen  and she became the envy of my dreams.  one by one her teasing movements  brought the crowd out of their seats  and all at once young scarlet  danced straight up in front of me  from the moment that her eyes found mine  i've never been the same  scarlet locked another heart upon her chain.  now i get scarlet fever every time i see her  but she's a night club teaser  not paid to notice me  yes  i get scarlet fever  if she knew how much i need her  she'd place her hand in my hand  and dance away with me.  she looked 25 but i was told  that she was just 16  she had a way of making a man believe  she danced for only him  as she tantalized i fantasized  and felt the sound of my heart beat  and every night i'd dream  she'd fall in love with me.  then one night while driving in  my eyes begun to tear  'cause the sign outside the lucky star said: scarlet isn't here  she'd left that day to find a life  of bigger and better things  and she left behind my chain of broken dreams.  but still get scarlet fever  in my mind i still see her  out there dancing somewhere  to another fool like me.  yes  i get... her heart has had more knocks than a gypsy's tambourine  yet it's worth more gold than any man has ever seen  and although no one has fallen for her like she's fallen for them  she says her heart isn't broken  it's only broken in  she's ready for someone to love her  someone to hold her tight  some to curl up next to when her feet get cold at night  she's weathered the whirlwind romance  stood through the one-night stands  she's ready for someone to love her  who'll be the lucky man  well she has had her fill of those unfullfilling men  you know the kind that come calling never to call back again  oh she's bound and determined not to be fooled anymore  and poor thing she'll keep that promise  the same way she kept it before  she's ready for someone to love her  someone to hold her tight  some to curl up next to when her feet get cold at night  she's weathered the whirlwind romance  stood through the one-night stands  she's ready for someone to love her  who'll be the lucky man  she's ready for someone to love her  someone to hold her tight  some to curl up next to when her feet get cold at night  she's

as they came out of the skies  they had high-tech horses with beacons in their eyes  my gun was cocked and ready when i looked into their face  i seen they just weren't just common buck-a-roos born of the human race  no  sir  these cowboys came from space  their shootin' irons shot laser light and their spurs was anodized  bandanas caked with stardust and their jeans was pressurized  well he handed me a halter  said  "tighten up the girth."  but before i hit the saddle we were miles above the earth.  and i mean miles above the earth  yippie-aye-ay-e  i seen london  paris  budapest  kashmir and tokyo  and there ain't no sight like a desert night looking down on mexico  to the moons of mars and jupiter  'round saturn's rings we rode  past the frozen plains of pluto where even the sunshine's cold  man  i do mean cold  then our interstellar stallions sailed through the starless void  there was nothing to miss in that emptiness  not even a stray asteroid  so we picked up the trail of a comet tail  man  you can't even dream that far  and the galloping beat like the rhythm of an old catgut guitar  just the strummin' of a distant star  yippie-aye-ay-e  well  it could have lasted minutes or a hundred thousand years  when they got me down  i was safe and sound and it hadn't even popped my ears  and they reared back on their broncos and they shot a bolt of light  i knew they were the good guys  yes  sir. you got it right  'cause their cowboy hats was white  so i asked 'em as they pulled their reins towards the settin' sun  i said  "before you go  i'd like to know  just where you boys come from?"  well they opened up a star chart and said  "right here where this 'x' is  it's the biggest place in outer space  the planet known as texas"  yippie-aye-ay-e  yippie-aye-ay-e  yippie-aye-ay-e  yippie-aye-ay-e    i just sat down to watch the game  when i heard the doorbell ring  an' i wondered who in the world it could be  through the peephole  all that i saw there  was a crooked cap on curly hair  an' some kid squintin' back at me    i said  "if you're sellin' somethin'  well  i ain't buyin' nothin'  but i appreciate you stoppin' by"  said  "i ain't askin' for a dime just a minute of your time  an' your name here on the dotted line  could you sign my petition?"    had a spiral notebook in his hand  handed me a chewed up pen  an' i ask you  "what am i signin' up for?"  i scrolled down that wrinkled page  saw a couple of neighbor's names  i kept readin' and i sat down on the porch    it was a letter to the president  with a list that numbered one to ten    it said  "make a law where daddys don't work late  keep uncle joe an' those soldiers safe  give those kids on tv all they want to eat  put a stop to bullies on the bus  no crime  no waits  no hate  no drugs  give a jacket and a job to people on the street"    i said  "son  sounds like a world i'd like to live in"  and i signed his petition    he thanked me for my time  i headed back inside  grabbed my beer  an' got back to the game  thought by now that boy  he's three doors down  here i am just sittin' round  waitin' on the world to change    must've blocked the whole game out  all that i could think about was    make a law where daddys don't work late  keep uncle joe an' those soldiers safe  give those kids on tv all they want to eat  put a stop to bullies on the bus  no crime  no waits  no hate  no drugs  give a blanket and a job to people on the street"    an' i thought  "man  ain't that a place i'd like to live in"  and i thank god for that boy that's out there

seattle never lives on white collared street  but there was food on the table for my washington woman and me    the work slowed down and the one day  the foreman laid me off  that night in a tavern down on my last dime  i met a girl from arkensal    her daddy was a banker in little rock  she had a mansion on white collared street  the next morning my washington woman woke up without me    from city to city  and state to state  i get her in shame  my washington woman had six months left  before out child would bring her pain    that arkensal woman hurt me  as we crossed the arkensal line  but the arms of seattle  are the arms that kept huggin' mine    for year i have basked in expensive wines  taste champagne every day  i gave up all the things i loved  for all these things i hate    i locked up all of her forgiveness  the day i set myself free  and the heart of my washington woman stopped beating for me    my washington woman sends me a letter every once in a while  inside a folded wordless page is a picture of my child  all but words  the room grows cold with a feeling of jealousy  and there's a silence between  my arkensal woman and me we only knew each other by letter   when i met her over the train   when the smoke cleared and the dust was still   she was standing there speaking my name.    i guarantee she looked like an angel   i couldn't think of what i should say   but when adam saw eve in the garden   i believe he felt the selfsame way.    i handed her up on the wagon   and i loaded up her trunk behind   she was sitting up there with the gold in her hair   i tried to get a hope on my mind.    you think that you could love me  mary?    you think we got a chance of a life   do you think that you could love me  mary?  now you are to be my wife.    we finally headed out of the station   and drove up my home trail   and when we came to the farm she laid a hand on my arm   i thought my resolution would fail.    now froze as she stepped through the doorway   and i stood there as still as could be   i said: "i know  it ain't much it needs a woman's touch   perhaps she turned around and looked at me."    do you think that ...    we had a prairie wedding   there was a preacher and a neighbor or two   i gave my golden thing  a gold wedding ring   and the both of us said  "i do".    now when the sun is going down in the prairie   and the golden hair is a flame   i say "do you really love me  mary?"  i hold her and i whisper her name.    do you think that...i was runnin' through the summer rain  try'n' to catch that evenin' train  and kill the old familiar pain weavin' through my tangled brain  when i tipped my bottle back and smacked into a cop i didn't see  that police man said  "mister cool  if you ain't drunk  then you're a  fool."  i said  "if that's against the law  then tell me why i never saw  a man locked in that jail of yours who wasn't neither black or poor as  me?"  well  that was when someone turned out the lights  and i wound up in jail to spend the night  and dream of all the wine and lonely girls  in this best of all possible worlds.  well  i woke up next mornin' feelin' like my head was gone  and like my thick old tongue was lickin' something sick and wrong  and i told that man i'd sell my soul for something wet and cold as that  old cell.  that kindly jailer grinned at me  all eaten up with sympathy  then poured himself another beer and came and whispered in my ear   "if booze was just a dime a bottle boy  you couldn't even buy the smell"  i said  "i knew there was something i liked about this town."  but it takes more than that to bring me down  down  down.  'cause there's still a lot of wine and lonely girls  in this best of all possible worlds  well  they finally came and told me they was a gonna set me free  and i'd be leavin' town if i knew what was good for me  i said  "it's nice to learn that ev'rybody's so concerned about my  health."   they were obsessed with it   i said  "i won't be leavin' no more quicker than i can  'cause i've enjoyed about as much of this as i can stand  and i don't need this town of yours more than i never needed nothin'  else."  'cause there's still a lot of drinks that i ain't drunk  and lots of pretty thoughts that i ain't thunk  and lord there's still so many lonely girls  in this best of all possible worlds. buddy  tip your bottle back  climb aboard the bus  join your brothers in the band  if you ain't bombed in burmingham  then you ain't one of us  we don't really give a damn  london is a hundred miles a-waitin' where we're at  and a thousand years behind  splitting from a sorry gig that left us feelin' flat  out of sight and out of mind  cruisin' through the countryside we'll never see again  ain't it lonesome out tonight?  we've been on that road now since i can't remember when  out of mind and out of sight  buddy tip your bottle back and climb aboard the bus  join your brothers in the band  if you ain't bombed in burmingham then you ain't one of us  we don't really give a damn  yeah  i been ev'rywhere and i seen ev'rything there is  but i never saw the light  scared to death of dyin' so i do my best to live  out of mind and out of sight  knowin' no one nowhere's gonna miss us when we're gone  let's keep drinkin' 'til we're blind  ev'rybody's sleepin' and i'm stuck inside a song  outta sight and outta line  someday when it's over and it's time to settle down  and we've left it all behind  we can sit and wonder how we ever got around  out of sight and out of mind  out of sight and out of mind well  they've made a golden idol of the girl you used to be  hangin' bangles on your branches like a lonely christmas tree.  yeah  they've dressed you fit for killin' in your thrillin' new disguise  nailin' artificial spangles to the diamonds in your eyes  in that golden coach that turns into a bed   you better make it  gal  before you wake up dead.

blackened stones   and the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.    cecil darby loved his wife  and he laboured all his life   to provide her with material possessions.  and he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.  and the building soon became his sole obsession.    oh  it took three-hundred days  for the timbers to be raised   and the silhouette was seen for miles around.  and the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky   but it only took one night to bring it down   when darby's castle tumbled to the ground.    though they shared a common bed  there was precious little said   in the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.  for his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build   and he never heard young helen darby weeping.    then one night he heard a sound  as he laid his pencil down   and he traced it to her door and turned the handle.  and the pale light of the moon through the window of the room   split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.    oh  it took three-hundred days  for the timbers to be raised   and the silhouette was seen for miles around.  and the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky   but it only took one night to bring it down   when darby's castle tumbled to the ground. i come from just the other side of nowhere  to this big time lonesome town.  they got a lot of ice and snow here   half as cold as all the people i've found.  every way i try to go here seems to bring me down.  i've seen about enough to know where i belong.  i've got a mind to see the headlights shining  on that old white line between my heart and home.  sick of spendin' sundays wishing they were mondays    sittin' in a park alone.  so give my best to anyone who's left who ever done me  any lovin' way but wrong.  tell 'em that the pride of just the other side o nowhere's  goin' home.    takin' nothin' back to show there  for these dues i've paid.  but the soul i almost sold here  and the body i've been givin' away.    fadin' from the neon nighttime glow here   headin' for the light of day   just the other side of nowhere  goin' home.  i've got a mind to see the headlights shinin'  on that old white line between my heart and home.  sick of spendin' sundays wishin' they were mondays   sittin' in a park alone.    so give my best to anyone who's left who ever done me  any lovin' way but wrong.

what i thought of marriage  and what's in store after their honeymoon.    and i was grumblin' to the dancers  'bout how men and women ought to live apart  and how a promise never made can not be broken  and can never break your heart    when suddenly from out of nowhere   a little girl came dancing 'cross the floor   and all her crinolines were billowing  beneath the skirt of calico that she wore.  oh what a joy fell on the honored guests  as each of them was drawn inside her dream   and they laughed and clapped and stomped their feet  and hollered at her "dance little jean"    dance  little jean  this day is for you   two people you love  stood up and said "i do"  dance little jean  the prayer that you had  was answered today  your mama's marrying your dad    well  my cynical heart just melted  'cause i knew what this get together meant  how it ended year of tears and sad confusion  that the little girl had spent.  well they told the band to pack it up  about the time the couple cut the cake   but we played as long as they stayed  for love and laughs and little jeanie's sake.    dance  little jean  this day is for you   two people you love  stood up and said "i do"  dance little jean  the prayer that you had  was answered today  your mama's marrying your dad all alone in a sleepless night  passing time with a runaway moon  talkin' to myself  wishing i was

hear you say you'll love me  until the end of time    i want to stand upon a rock  like i did when i was young   and hold you close beside me  and watch our children run  cause you only get one chance to listen to th wind   and when it's gone  it won't be back again  we only get one chance  so listen to the wind   cause when it's gone  it won't be back again.sittin' on the front porch tryin' to

hank williams with them good old "lovesick blues"  it's time for roy acuff to go to memphis on his train  with minnie pearl and rod brasfield and lazy jim day  turn on all your radios i know that you will wait  hear little jimmy dickens sing "take an old cold tater and wait"  there'll be guitars and fiddles  earl scruggs and his banjo too  bill monroe singing out them ole kentucky blues  ernest tubb's number "two wrongs won't make a right"  at the grand ole opry ev'ry saturday night  there was uncle dave macon his gold tooth and plug-hat  cowboy copas singing "tragic romance"  signed sealed and delivered with sam and kirk mcgee  and the master of ceremony was mr. george d. hays  there was lonzo and oscar a-poppin' bubble gum  george morgan singin' "candy kisses" yum yum  "got a hole in

them ole kentucky blues  ernest tubb's number too wrongs won't make a right  at the grand ole opry ev'ry saturday night  you can talk about your singers in all kinds of way  but none could sing the old songs like bradley kincaid  with his old hound dog "guitar" and the famous "blue tail fly"  stringbean with hank snow and old fiddlin' chubby wise  there'll be guitars and fiddles  earl scruggs and his banjo too  bill monroe singin' out them ole kentucky blues  ernest tubb's number "two wrongs don't make a right"  at the grand ole opry ev'ry saturday night way back in my memory there's a scene that i recall  of a little run-down cabin in the woods  where my dad never promised that our blue moon would turn gold  but he laid awake nights wishin' that it would.    when the world was on our radio  hard work was on our minds.  we lived our day-to-day in plain dirt fashion   with ol' overalls and cotton balls all strapped across your back  man  it's hard to make believe there ain't nothing wrong.    but momma kept the bible read and daddy kept our family fed   and somewhere in between i must have grown  cause someday i was dreamin' that a song that i was singin'  takes me down the road to where i want to go.    now i know  it's a long hard road    sometimes i remember when i stay up late at night   when the sun-up came  we got up and went  in the shadows of a working' day  our moonlight hours spent  singin' songs along with gramma's radio.    now i'm beatin' down a ol' blacktop road  sleepin' in a sack   livin' in my memories all in vain  'cause those city lights ain't all that bright  compared to what it's like  to see lightning bugs go dancin' in the rain.    momma played the guitar then  and daddy made the saw blade bend   and raindrops played the tin roof like a drum.  but i just kept on dreamin' that a song that i was singin'  takes me down the road to where my name is known.    now i'm gone  and it's a long hard road  yes  i know  it's a long hard road. the promoter says he wants to cancel  cause there ain't enough tickets sold  the air conditioner on the bus just broke  and i cant shake this cold    the single lost the bullet   the singers losin' his wife  well i might be crazy but i wouldn't change  a single thing about this life.    sometimes we feel like champions   sometimes we just cant win   sometimes our records hit the top of the charts  or the discount bargain bins.      through 30 years of touring  we've remained partners  brothers  and friends  we keep it together cause we love it and were sure  well be big time before it all ends.    well you know you've got the nitty gritty  and jimmy's got his drums along  then jeffrey and me and bobby will be  singing all our favorite songs    catch the fire from the folks in the front row  fan the flames as the beat gets strong  its great to be a part of something  so good that's lasted so long    well i saw a story in the paper  suddenly the bands big news  the critics all like our records just fine  but they seem a bit confused    is it folk or rock or country  seems like everybody cares but us  so just leave us an early wake up call  so we don't miss the bus        the band says it cant stand my latest song  its too personal  but my first wife's second marriage blew up  she had to get the dang thing annulled  well if that ain't something to sing about  well you tell me what is  and well give it a beat and put it on the street  and we just might have another hit     in 1814 we took a little trip   along with colonel jackson down the mighty mississippi.  we took a little bacon and we took a little beans   and we fought the bloody british in the town of new orleans.    we fired our guns and the british kept a comin'   there wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.  we fired once more and they began to runnin'  on down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico.    oh we looked down the river and we seen the british come.  there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on a drum.  they stepped so high and they made their bugles ring.  we stood behind our cotton bales and didn?t say a thing.    old hickory said we could take 'em by surprise   if we didn't fire our muskets till we looked 'em in the eyes.  we held our fire till we seen their faces well   then we opened up our squirrel guns and gave 'em a little  well  we    fired our guns and the british kept a comin'   there wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.  we fired once more and they began to runnin'  on down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico.    we fired our cannons till the barrels melted down   then we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round.  we filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind   and when we touched the powder off  the gator lost his mind.    we fired our guns and the british kept a comin'   there wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.  we fired once more and they began to runnin'  on down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico.    we fired our guns and the british kept a comin'   there wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.  we fired once more and they began to runnin'  on down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico. get up on your high horse  woman  get up on your high horse now  and get up on your high horse  woman  i'll make it up to you somehow    moonlit shadow  she starts a trippin' firelight

easily to heaven above.  blue spruce clinin' to the grade in the evening  they take the chill away fine.  cut the telephone line and the story's the same.    there's a worn red chair by the window  that we found at a sale down the way  when some old women said that they  needed more room for the winter.  people like pullin' at the stuffin' when they sit down.  it helps passin' the time.  cut the

world a warmer place  by the sparklin' of your diamond face.  on a frayed spot put a little lace.  and you make me feel fine.  warm as the mountain sunshine  on the edge of the snow line  in a meadow of columbine.    oh little jennifer  i'd give a penny for  what you got on your mind.  seems like most of the time you're lyin' there dreamin'.  maybe in your visions you've seen how omniscient is  slightly less than divine.  cut the telephone line and the story's the same.    ripplin' water's flowin' through the pipes  in the walls that are keepin' me warm.  the closest i've been to my family for days is my music.  silently starin' at the mornin' sky  it's just like hearin' her callin' my name.  cut the telephone line and the story might change.    and oh  like a bubble on a windy day  i

she's seventeen again    football games and leaves are cracklin'  walking her home in his leather jacket  you can see it all goin' down  a perfect night on a front porch glider    sayin' goodnight for the next three hours  her tired eyes grow wide and bright  when she talks about that town  tomorrow she won't remember what she did today  but just ask her about ellsworth  kansas  1948    while the world is fading all around her  sharin' a sundae at the counter  he's goin' on and on about her    bet she's right there right now  tomorrow she won't remember what she did today  but just ask her

numbers changed    it's been at least a year since i called you up to say  we need to talk i got this job and i think i'm going to take it  'cause i been waiting all my life  for a break like this    it's my chance of a lifetime i just know it is  i gotta go find these dreams  was the last thing that i said  and then i did    i can see clear to the mountains as i head up our old street  i remember how we'd call in sick on days like these  and turn the music up roll the windows down and just drive  you talked me outta givin' up on myself so many times  convinced me to get in while i could regrets hang heavy on the mind  but you never doubted me you kept pushing me    saying you've been waiting all your life for a break like this  it's your chance of a lifetime you just know it is  you gotta go find those dreams  was the last thing that you said  and then i did    but you were wrong  love was what i wanted all along  and now you're gone    i thought about calling you when i got off the plane  every time i see this city through the clouds i get that way    but you were wrong  love was what i wanted all along hey baby  is that you?  wow your hair got so long.  yea  yea! i love it  i really do.    norma jean ain't that the song  we'd sing in the car  drivin' down town   top down makin' the rounds   checkin' out the bands on dull hinney avenue.    yea life throws you curves   but you learned to swerve.  me i swung and i miss  and the next thing you know i'm reminiscing.  dreaming old dreams   wishing old wishes   like we would be back again.      i wake up and tear drops   they fall down like rain.  i put on that old song we danced to and then   i head off to my job   guess not much has changed.  punch the clock.  head for home.  check the phone   just in case.  go to bed   dream of you   that's what i'm doing these days.    yea that's what i'm doing.    someone told me  after college   you ran off to vegas   you married a rodeo cowboy...why  that ain't the girl i knew.    me i've been a few places   mostly here and there once or twice.  still sortin' out life  but i'm doing alright.  yea  it's good to see you too.    well hey girl  you're late.  and those planes they don't wait.  but if you ever come back around  this sleepy old town   promise me you'll stop in  to see an old friend   and until then        [repeat x3]  i wake up and tear drops   they fall down like rain.  i put on that old song we danced to and then  can't get enough of this everyday love  can't get enough of this everyday love    each morning the sun shines through my window  lands on the face of a dream come true  i shuffle to the kitchen for my coffee  and catch up on the front page morning news  then she walks up behind me and throws her arms around my neck  just another normal thing i've come to expect    it's ordinary plain and simple  typical  this everyday love  same 'ol  same 'ol keeping it new   same 'ol this everyday love   emotional  so familiar  nothing about it too peculiar  oh  but i can't get enough  of this everyday love    every afternoon i make a phone call  listen to the voice that warms my heart  i drag myself through a few more hours  then head on home to try and beat the dark  her smile will be right there when i step through that door  and it will be that way tomorrow  just like everyday before    it's ordinary plain and simple  typical  this everyday love  same 'ol  same 'ol keeping it new   same 'ol this everyday love   emotional  so familiar  nothing about it too peculiar  oh  but i can't get enough  of this everyday love    wouldn't change one single thing about it  no  it's run-of-the-mill  still i can't live with-out it    it's ordinary plain and simple  typical  this everyday love  same 'ol  same 'ol keeping it new   same 'ol this everyday love   emotional  so familiar  nothing about it too peculiar  oh  but i can't get enough  of this everyday love    yeah  of this everyday love  can't get enough of this everyday love  can't get enough of this everyday love  can't get enough of this everyday love  can't get enough of this everyday love  can't get enough i can take the rain on the roof of this empty house  that don't bother me  i can take a few tears now and then and just let 'em out  i'm not afraid to cry every once in a while  even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me  there are days every now and again i pretend i'm okay  but that's not what gets me      what hurts the most was being so close  and havin' so much to say  and watchin' you walk away  and never knowin' what could've been  and not seein' that lovin' you  is what i was trying to do    it's hard to deal with the pain of losin' you everywhere i go  but i'm doing it  it's hard to force that smile when i see our old friends and i'm alone  still harder gettin' up  gettin' dressed  livin' with this regret  but i know if i could do it over  i would trade  give away all the words that i saved in my heart  that i left unspoken    what hurts the most was being so close  and havin' so much to say  and watchin' you walk away  and never knowin' what could've been  and not seein' that lovin' you  is what i was trying to do  oh         not seeing that lovin' you   that's what i was trying to do  ooh i was sittin' on a bar stool  in a barbecue joint in tennessee  when this old boy walked in  and he sat right down next to me    i could tell he'd been through some hard times  there were tear stains on his old shirt  and he said  "you wanna know what you get  when you play a country song backwards?"    you get your house back  you get your dog back  you get your best friend jack back  you get your truck back    you get your hair back  you get your first and second wives back  your front porch swing  your pretty little thing    your bling  bling  bling and a diamond ring  you get your farm  and the barn  and the boat  and the harley  first night in jail with charlie    it sounds a little crazy  a little scattered and absurd  but that's what you get  when you play a country song backwards    well  i never heard it said quite like that  it hit me in the face 'cause that's where i'm at  i almost fell flat out on the floor  he said  "wait a minute  that's not all  there's even more."    you get your mind back  you get your nerves back  your first heart attack back  you get your pride back    you get your life back  you get your first real love back  you get your big screen tv  a dvd  and a washing machine    you get the pond  and the lawn  and the bail  and the mower  you go back where you don't know her  it sounds a little crazy    a little scattered and absurd  but that's what you get  when you play a country song backwards  oh play that song!    we sat there and shot the bull  about how it would be  if we could turn it all around  and change this c-r-a-p    you get your house back  you get your dog back  you get your best friend jack back  you get your truck back    you get your hair back  you get your first and second wives back  your front porch swing  your pretty little thing    your bling  bling  bling and a diamond ring  you get your farm  and the barn  and the boat  and

mountain dew can with lipstick on it  rollin' round his truck bed.  he just leaves it back there   one of the things he has left of her  when he drives into the late day sun  you can see a set of footprints.  he ain't going to clean that windshield   he'd rather just live with the hurt.    he's holdin' on to the wheel  to the way she made him feel.  to the shifter  to the pictures.  every precious moment with her.  like the left behind colors in the sky  when the sun is gone.  he's holdin' on.  oh  he's holdin' on.    there's that voice mail on his cell phone  he don't dare erase.  she ended with i love you   and he saves it just in case  it might still be true.  no he ain't through.    he's holdin' on to the wheel  to the way she made him feel.  to the shifter  to the pictures.  every precious moment with her.  like the left behind colors in the sky  when the sun is gone.  he's holdin' on.    to the past  to the last time he held her  the breath on his neck.  the three words she said.    oh  oh  oh     he's holdin' on to the wheel  to the way she made him feel.  to the shifter  to the pictures.  every precious moment with her.    he's holdin' on  yeah  he's holdin' on

trigger back  stopped little tommy in his tracks  and said  "get up  man"  people came from miles to say goodbye  to the wilson's youngest son  his innocent life had just begun      it's not supposed to go like that  it's not intended to end that way  life is a journey constantly turning  down an unknown path  but it's not supposed to go like that    jimmy had his daddy's car  and the keys to jenny's heart  a fifth of whiskey on the floorboard  almost gone  havin' the time of their life  had only one thing on their mind  never saw the flashin' lights  or the train comin' on  now there's a wreath and two small crosses  on the right side of the road  reminders of a love that won't grow        i wonder if guardian angels cry  when they see it all played out  and as they stand with their hands tied  oh  do they cry out loud    it's not suppose to go like that  no  it's not supposed to go like that  no  it's not supposed to go like that  no  it's not supposed to go like that  no  it's not supposed  it's not supposed to go like that  no  no  no  it's not supposed to go like that whooo umm yeah  life's like a road that you travel on  when there's one day here and the next day gone  sometimes you bend and sometimes you stand  sometimes you turn your back to the wind  there's a world outside every darkened door  where blues won't haunt you anymore  where brave are free and lovers soar  come ride with me to the distant shore  we won't hesitate  to break down the garden gate  there's not much time left today        life is a highway  i wanna ride it all night long  if you're going my way  i wanna drive it all night long  gimme gimme gimme gimme yeah    through all these cities and all these towns  it's in my blood and it's all around  i love you now like i loved you then  this is the road and these are the hands  from mozambique to those memphis nights  the khyber pass to vancouver's lights  knock me down and back up again  you're in my blood i'm not a lonely man  there's no load i can't hold  a road so rough this i know  i'll be there when the light comes in  tell 'em we're survivors    [chorus:repeat x2]    there was a distance between you and i  a misunderstanding once  but now we look in the eye    there ain't no load that i can't hold  a road so rough this i know  i'll be there when the light comes in  tell 'em we're survivors    [chorus:repeat x3] lying here with you  i watch you while you sleep  the dawn is closing in  with every breath you breathe    i can feel the change  the change you've made in me  but will i ever see  all the things you see in me    when you say that i'm one of a kind  baby  i don't see it but you believe  that i'm so strong and true  i promise you  i'll try to be that kind of man  because you love me like i am    when it comes to love  i may not know the rules  but there's one thing i know  my heart belongs to you  just you    when you say that i'm one of a kind  baby  i don't see it but you

 but sometimes it does    standing beside her the stars shined even brighter  and for a moment all the world was  all the world was still  i knew we belonged together the moment my eyes met hers  and i thought nothing last forever  but maybe this one will    a deep breath and baby steps  that's how the whole thing starts  it's a long slow beautiful dance  to the beat of a heart    the world starts to spin again  you learn things you didn't know then  feels like the bloom is off the rose  but you weather a few storms and you pull out a few thorns  and together the garden grows and grows    a deep breath and baby steps  that's how the whole thing starts  it's a long slow beautiful dance  to the beat of a heart    it's a long slow beautiful dance    the house is filled with so much love  we got more than enough for two  so we've been thinking about having a baby  i know it sounds crazy  but it seems like the natural thing to do    a deep breath and baby steps  that's how the whole thing starts  it's a long slow beautiful dance  to the beat of a heart    it's a long slow  it's a long slow  it's a long slow it' s 3 a. m. and you' re still wide awake  wonderin' how much more your broken

a sunset  hey it happens to us all  when the cold hard rain just won't quit  and you can't see your way out of it    you find your faith has been lost and shaken  here's your chance and it's worth taking  get on your knees and dig down deep  you can do what you think is impossible  keep on believing don't give in  you've got the strength to raise the wind  remember what one dream can do  you are unstoppable    you  you can weather any storm  don't you know that you were born to win  oh  you find a helping hand when you need it most  a lighthouse shining on the coast that never goes dim  when your back's against the wall  when you  when you stumble and you fall    you find your faith has been lost and shaken  here's your chance and it's worth taking  get on your knees and dig down deep  you can do what you think is impossible  keep on believing don't give in  you've got the strength to raise the wind  remember what one dream can do  you are unstoppable    like a river keeps on rolling  like a north wind blowing  don't it feel good knowing  yeah    you find your faith has been lost and shaken  you take back what's been taken  get on your knees and dig down deep  you can do what you think is impossible  keep on believing don't give in  you've got the strength to raise the wind  remember what one dream can do  you are unstoppable    yes you  you are unstoppable  so you made a lot of mistakes  but you got right back into the game  you  you are unstoppableit's a dangerous world we live in  crime is everywhere  there's always some sad story going down    you can read it in the paper  you can see it on the air  it's an evil epidemic going round    but nobody seems to notice  the saddest crime of all  oh just how many times a day  someone takes their love away  and the national statistics  never put it in the chart  but every second someone breaks a heart    there's a woman out there somewhere  who feels she lost her life  but her man just shot her world down  and it hurts    there's a guy who just got taken  and it cuts him like a knife  some girl stole his heart and left him  without a world    they don't call it a crime of passion  but it kills you just the same  it's murder when a true love dies  right before your very eyes    and as soon as one is over  another one will start  every second someone breaks  every second someone breaks a heart    if you've got someone who loves you  be careful all the time  do you know where your love is tonight  cause there's always someone trying  to find the perfect crime  and you never know just when  they'll strike    so you better watch your woman  and you better watch your man  cause no one's safe when love's at stake  anybody's heart can break    and the next time that it happens  you're not the losing part  every second someone breaks a heart  every second someone breaks a heart  every second someone breaks a heart now kids hang on just a second before we start  you know there's a reason we are all here in front of grandma and  grandpa's  christmas tree  and if trevor and e.p. would quit fighting long enough and be real quiet  this little song might help ya understand  long ago in a stable there was a baby being born  his parents were joseph and mary  and joseph's big ole heart was torn  cause he couldn't find a decent place for mary to have her child  but mary said it just seemed just right and she blessed it with her  smile  cause what made it special was the baby in her arms  god sent him down to give the world a second chance for you and i  that's why we have christmas at this time each year  it's the baby's birthday party that brings us so much cheer  now kids the presents that all of you exchange on christmas  represents the gifts that baby jesus received the night he was born  he got all his presents from three wise men  who followed a star  and walked a long long way to the stable  so everytime you tear open one of your presents  think about that baby and say  happy birthday jesus  i'll open this one for you  cause what made it special was the baby in her arms  god sent him down to give the world a second chance for you and i  that's why we have christmas at this time each year  it's the baby's birthday party that brings us so much cheer  ok all together now  happy birthday jesus  i'll open this one just for you   they say that it's the same the whole world over  that love's the hardest thing to understand  i thought once in love my troubles would blow over  but it seems that's when the heartache just begins    and i remember when you first said that you love me  i tried not to let the words go to my head  the things you said you spoke so sincerely  somewhere in between the lines of red    is it really love  is it really love  or just my heart playing tricks on me  i fall so easily  is my heart telling me  that i'm your fool  or is it really love    this time love's got me feeling so uncertain  my heart's seen all the breaks that it can take  i can't tell you if this is just infatuation  or another chance to learn from my mistakes    is it really love  is it really love  or just my heart playing tricks on me  i fall so easily  is my heart telling me  that i'm your fool  or is it really love    i'm a little bit leary  of the love 'em and leave 'em behind kind  i'm just a little bit weary  cause other lovers like messing with my mind  oh all the time    is it really love  is it really love  or just my heart playing tricks on me  i fall so easily  is my heart telling me  that i'm your fool  or is it really love    am i your fool  or is it really love all my life i've looked at love as a fairy tale  a woman a man never never land and a storybook ending  leading roles and my heros upon the silver screen  i played em all but always came up empty  but one of these days i'll be in a movie with 'em    cause i believe that fantasy  is one step from reality  for those of us who dream of love  and i believe cause i want to  there's some one man for someone who believes in love  to not give up  even though you've heard so many say  that's the way the story goes      i'm lookin' for a new love story  i'm lookin' for a yellow brick road  that'll carry me to his door  i'm lookin for a new love story  oh one that's never been told before    and i have searched the oceans of many a man's eyes  but i have yet to feel like more than some deserted island  i know a relationship will come for me in time  and i can't wait to see his face on my horizon  cause one of these days he'll sail into my life    cause i believe that fantasy  is one step from reality  for those of us who dream of love  and i believe cause i want to  there's some one man for someone who believes in love  to not give up  even though you've heard so many say  that's the way the story goes     we had a fight  a lover's quarrel  angry words spoken in haste  deep in the night  it went out of control  and with tears streaming down my face  i slammed the door and i walked out  swearing that we were through  now i'm sitting in a bar  thinking i've gone too far  wondering what i'm gonna do  thinking about calling you      to my left blue collar  to my right a high dollar man  across the bar a smooth bartender  who thinks i'm in the palm of his hand  well they buy me drinks  light my cigarette  they're all wondering which one i'm gonna choose  oh my hand's on my glass  my second margarita  and my mind is on you  my mind is on you    well i ran away  in a moment of weakness  i couldn't hold my own  i should stay  because being together  means more than who was right or wrong  and sitting in a room full of lonely faces  you're the only one i see  if you only knew  i was thinking of you  would you come and rescue me  maybe i should call and see         my third margarita     i should of known i could never get along  outside of your love  it's last call  and i'm out of cigarettes  they are all wondering what i'm gonna do  oh my hand's on the glass  it's my last margarita  and my mind is on you  my mind is on you  my mind is on you jamie turned 13 tonight  but she didn't blow out the birthday lights  jamie and her momma had another big

are always sad  we trade a couple words and looks  and kids again  every other weekend    every other weekend  very few exceptions  i pick up the love we made in both my arms  it's movies on the sofa  grilled cheese and cut the crust off  but that's not the way mom makes it  daddy breaks my heart  i miss everything we used to have with her again  every other weekend      i can't tell her i love her  i can't tell him i love him  cause there's too many questions and ears in the car  so  i don't tell him i miss him  i don't tell her i need her  she's over me that's where we are  he's over me that's where we are  we're as close as we might ever be again  every other weekend    every other saturday  first thing in the morning  i turn the tv on to make the quiet go away  i know why but i don't know why  we ever let this happen  fallin' for forever was a big mistake  there's so much not to do and all day not do it in  every other weekend    every other sunday  i empty out my backseat  while my children hug their mother in the parking lot  we don't touch  we don't talk much  maybe goodbye to each other  as she drives away with every piece of heart i've got  i re-convince myself we did the right thing  every other weekend        yeah  for fifteen minutes  we're a family again  god i wish that he was still with me again  every other weekend you're asking me to open up  i'm tryin' my best to give enough  to keep this love alive  it wouldn't be so hard for me to do  if it hadn't have been for all my heart's been through    but once you've learned to be lonely  and lonely is the only thing you've known  it begins to feel like home  it becomes your comfort zone    and once you've learned to be without someone  and settle for the silence of an empty room  oh  it changes you  there's a lot you have to undo  once you've learned to be lonely    it becomes a habit of the heart  to be afraid to even start  to try and love again  i want to give you myself to you  but i've been alone that i'm scared to move    but once you've learned to be lonely  and lonely is the only thing you've known  it begins to feel like home  it becomes your comfort zone    once you've learned to be without someone  and settle for the silence of an empty room  oh it changes you  there's a lot you have to undo  once you've learned to be lonely    i've built these walls but i feel them falling down  touch by touch your love is my way out    but once you've learned to be lonely  and lonely is the only thing you've known  it begins to feel like home  it becomes your comfort zone    once you've learned to be without someone  and settle for the silence of an empty room  oh it changes you  there's a lot you have to undo  once you've learned to be lonely  there's a lot you have to undo  once you've learned to be lonely. i remember it all very well lookin' back  it was the summer i turned eighteen  we lived in a one room  rundown shack  on the outskirts of new orleans  we didn't have money for food or rent  to say the least we were hard pressed  then mama spent every last penny we had  to buy me a dancin' dress    mama washed and combed and curled my hair  and she painted my eyes and lips then i stepped into a satin  dancin' dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip  it was red velvet trim and it fit me good  standin' back from the lookin' glass  there stood a woman where a half gown kid had stood    she said here's your one chance fancy don't let me down  here's your one chance fancy don't let me down    mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck  and she kissed my cheek  then i saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes  when she started to speak  she looked at a pitiful shack  and then she looked at me and took a ragged breath  she said your pa's run off and i'm real sick  and the baby's gonna starve to death    she handed me a heart shaped locket that said  "to thine own self be true"  and i shivered as i watched a roach crawl across  the toe of my high heel shoe  it sounded like somebody else that was talkin'  askin' mama what do i do  she said just be nice to the gentlemen fancy  and they'll be nice to you    she said here's your chance fancy don't let me down  here's your one chance fancy don't let me down  lord forgive me for what i do  but if you want out  well it's up to you  now don't let me down you better start movin' uptown    well  that was the last time i saw my ma  the night i left that rickety shack  the welfare people came and took the baby  mama died and i ain't been back    but the wheels of fate had started to turn  and for me there was no way out  and it wasn't very long 'til i knew exactly  what my mama's been talkin' about    i knew what i had to do but i made myself this solemn vow  that i's gonna be a lady someday  though i don't know when or how  i couldn't see spending the rest of my life  with my head hung down in shame you know  i might have been born just plain white trash  but fancy was my name    here's your one chance fancy don't let me down  here's your one chance fancy don't let me down    it wasn't very long after a benevolent man  took me off the street  and one week later i was pourin' his tea  in a five room hotel suite    i charmed a king  a congressman  and an occasional aristocrat  then i got me a georgia mansion  in an elegant new york townhouse flat  and i ain't done bad    now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrite  that would call me bad  and criticize mama for turning me out  no matter how little we had    but though i ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'  for nigh on fifteen years  i can still hear the desperation in my poor  mama's voice ringin' in my ear    she said  here's your one chance fancy don't let me down  here's your one chance fancy don't let me down  lord  forgive me for what i do  but if you want out well it's up to you  now don't let me down  your mama's gonna help you uptown    i guess she did love takes the patience of job  that's what my mama always said  faith is the belief in something more than what you know  that's what the good book says  you gotta play the cards you got  who knows what fate is holding  at times you gotta go without knowing where you're going    that's why i keep on lovin' you  i keep on lovin' you  through the baby don't leave mes  and never will agains  and i promise tos  i keep on lovin' you    lord knows we've had our share of fights  our sleepless nights  our ups and downs  we've had plenty and then some of baby i'm gones and turnarounds  sometimes i swear it might be easier to throw in the towel  someday we're gonna look back  say look at us now    that's why i keep on lovin' you  i keep on lovin' you  through the baby don't leave mes  and never will agains  and i promise tos  i keep on lovin' you    keep on lovin' you  through the i take it backs  i didn't mean it like that's  i'd never hurt yous  oh  i keep on lovin' you    i keep on lovin' you  i keep on lovin' you  through the i take it backs  i didn't mean it like that  i'd never hurt yous  oh  i keep on lovin' you  i keep on lovin' you  i keep on lovin' you everybody told me he was a dream  picture perfect like he stepped right off the silver screen  said that he would sweep me off my feet  but i'm still standing no he didn't do it for me  'cause i don't go for all that wine and dine  with the ray ban fake tan never mind    i want a down home up with the sun rise man  a pick-up truck driving bull riding strong steady hand  i want the wranglers stetson and all that stuff  i want the real mccoy  i want a cowboy    i'm tired of talking 'bout it wasting my time  on all the cheap talkers needing me feeding me lines  give me somebody who's tender but tough  simple and honest knows a thing or two about love  i've seen enough to know i know what i like  it's the hard working head turning rugged type    i want a down home up with the sun rise man  a pick-up truck driving bull riding strong steady hand  i want the wranglers stetson and all that stuff  i want the real mccoy  i want a cowboy    i've seen enough to know you know what i mean  ride me off into the sunset that's my thing    i want a down home up with the sun rise man  a pick-up truck driving bull riding strong steady hand  i want the wranglers stetson and all that stuff  i want the real mccoy  i want the real mccoy  i want a cowboy  i want a cowboy a cowboy no  i don't want no 'jack n coke'  please sit me where there ain't no smoke  don't want nothin' cloudin' up my eyes  but you see that girl all over there  actin' like she's on thin air  there got to be a secret to her smile  well  i think that i just found him  and he's twirlin' her around  i'd like to place my order  you might want to write this down    i'll have what she's havin'  i want what she's got  someone sweet as he can be  and by the way  that hot  a tall order  i suppose  but if you could find me one of those  i'll have what she's havin'    well  i like the way he looks at her  it's plain to see  he knows the words  that makes her shine from 40 feet away  if there's any justice in this world  he's got a twin who wants a girl  who looks like me  excuse me while i pray  so if you could slip my number  in that pocket on his hip  it would be appreciated  and reflected in your tip    i'll have what she's havin'  i want what she's got  someone sweet as he can be  and by the way  that hot  a tall order  i suppose  but if you can find me one of those  i'll have what she's havin'    a tall order  i suppose  but if you can find me one of those  i'll have what she's havin'    well  i know it's wrong to think of it  but why should she have all of it  i'll have what she's havin'    oh  i'll have what she's havin' 3 o'clock in the mornin' when the telephone started ringin  i had a feelin' it wouldd be you  i'd didn't want to take it but i let my imagination think  of some kind of trouble you gotten into  and i just had to answer n you had to stop cryin  and i  i tried to fight it  but i thought if i didn't listen to you  that i wouldn''t be much of a friend  i let you come over n cry on my shoulder  for the hundredth time over again  and all those old emotions came rainin out of the room  just when i thought i'd stopped lovin' you    you got a way of knowin when i'm on the edge of givin in  and how to use those beautiful eyes  so if one day you're askin' me  if i ever thought that maybe  we outta give it one more try?  and i just had to answer n you  you had to start smilin  and i thought about lyin'  but i thought if i wasn't honest with you  that i wouldn't be much of a friend  i let you come over n cry on my shoulder  for the hundredth time over again  and all those old emotions came rainin' out of the room  just when i thought i'd stopped lovin' you    oh i hate you for makin' me crazy  so why is it that i...  i keep on takin' you right back baby?  but i thought if i didn't listen to you  that i wouldn't be much of a friend  i let you come over n cry on my shoulder  for the hundredth time over again  and all those old emotions came rainin' out of the room  just when i thought i'd stopped lovin' you  just when i thought i'd stopped lovin' you    you take two steps down the highway  but you come runnin' back  what am i supposed to do?  what am i supposed to do?  what am i supposed to do with that?  wrap my arms around you!  yeah eh yeah she was circling the holiday inn  just about to go 'round again  when her cell phone rang  and it was him sayin'  "room 183"    they've never done this before  but when he met her at the door  they broke out smiling 'cause they were sure  that this is what they need  she said  "mama's got the kids"  and he said  "we got the room for the weekend"    they love their kids and their house  and that dog in the yard  oh and their neighbors for the most part  they love each other but it's hard to be lovers  when life gets in the way  sometimes love needs a holiday    he hung out the 'do not disturb'  to shut out the rest of the world  48 hours of just him and her  you can't get this at home    she pulled the covers back and  he said  "yeah i'm in to that"  they flopped down together and took a nap  no  you can't get this at home  they woke up in each other's arms  and that's where they spent the rest of the weekend    they love their kids and their house  and that dog in the yard  oh and their neighbors for the most part  they love each other but it's hard to be lovers  when life gets in the way  sometimes love needs a holiday    room service dinner with candles and wine  a night with no homework and no baby crying  they hold each other like they used to do  he whispers  "girl  i've missed you"    they love their kids and their house  and that dog in the yard  oh and their neighbors for the most part  they love each other but it's hard to be lovers  when life gets in the way  sometimes love needs a holiday  needs a holiday    he hung out the 'do not disturb'  love needs a holiday   love needs a holiday   just shut out the rest of the world  love needs a holiday   love needs a holiday  verse 1  mama stood on the front porch ringin' her hands  watched the tail lights fadin' on his black tranzam  with her precious little baby taking off inside  staring at him with stars in her eyes  she tried to tell her but the girl might as well have been deaf  she wasn't gonna listen to a word she said  chorus  don't go down maggie creek road  with a boy lookin' like that  he'll tell ya thangs that you wanna hear  and they'll be no turnin' back  there's an oak tree down by the lake  in the shade where the wild flowers grow  what'll happen only heaven knows  so don't go down maggie creek road   at the end ........don't go down....... maggie creek road   verse 2  was a still black night as dark is cold  nobody heard her when she said no  she kicked and screamed and got free somehow  tore her dress on the door when he pushed her out  she walked 13 miles on the gravel road  with tears in her eyes 20 years ago  chorus  verse 3  somehow mama's always know  cause they shoulda been home an hour ago  when she pulled up it was just going down  she turned her headlights off didn't make a sound  she heard her baby crying no but he wouldn't stop  her heart went cold and her blood ran hot  with a pistol in her hand she opened his door  you don't wanna see mama go to war  chorus   moving oleta was the hardest thing he'd done  the nurses saw an old woman cryin'  but he saw the love of his life  she don't know where she is  but she knows this isn't home  love is a hard  hard road    he met her in the summer of '37  in a brush arbor down on the rush creek shore  he loved her black hair and the mischief in her smile  but she won him with her eyes    all the years and children gone   he still sees her the same  love is a hard  hard road    he woke up each morning and drove into town  he stayed all day till her dinner came  then he took her to a room  leaned on her wheelchair like a walker  covered her with a quilt she'd made  only god and a couple of nurses helped the old man shoulder the load  love is a hard  hard road    he said "they tell me this is all that's left   say this hell on earth is best   i lost all those reasons and i still don't understand"  he cursed his body old and weak  tears of failure burned his cheeks  he said "oh  don't you know i prayed to die before this day"  love is a hard  hard road    there's a shadow much darker than the valley of death  when you fear the reaper night not come today  the line 'em up in laz-e-boys out in the sunroom  the tv keeps the quiet away  she can't recall his name and she's the only love he's known  love is a hard  hard road  love is a hard  hard road  moving oleta was the hardest thing he'd done. hey girl  it's me  just called to tell you hi  call me when you get this  haven't talked lately  so hard to find the time  give the boys a big kiss  tell them that i miss them  by the way  i miss you too  i was thinking just today  about how we used to play  barbie dolls and makeup  tea parties  dress up  i remember how we'd fight  and make up and

and invite him home for christmas  to meet the family  seems like just yesterday   you brought home oh what's his name  he had been drinking  what were you thinking?  after dinner he passed out   we can laugh about it now  'cause we've learned a lot since then  my sister  my friend    do you think you could come and  see me sometime soon?  see me sometime soon   we could just hang out like we used to    it's late and i should go   but i can't hang up the phone  until i tell you what i don't tell you enough  even though at times it seemed  we were more like enemies  i'd do it all again  my sister  my friend    oh  my sister  my friend. when you walked out that door  i was so sure my world had ended  so sure i'd never get over you    on that first night alone  i cried so many tears it

what i've learned without you  and the days roll on and my heart gets stronger too  don't think i didn't love you  just because i made it through  but i learned to love myself  without you    i can even see myself  falling in love with somebody else  ready to take that chance again  cause i know now  what i didn't know then    that the world still turns and the sun still burns  and that's what i've learned without you  and the days roll on and my heart gets stronger too  don't think i didn't love you  just because i made it through  but i learned to love myself  without youout on the plains

up at the screen   all flights were delayed  when a voice behind me asked  "stranger how have you been?"  i was caught off guard when i saw her face  stumbled my way through an awkward embrace  yet somehow i managed to say "good to see you again"  we caught up on old friends  caught up on old times  but all through the small talk  it kept burning through my mind    does she think about the nights we spent on crystal lake  wrapped up in a blanket 'til the break of day  so many times i wondered does she think of me that way  i didn't ask and she didn't say    trading stories and pictures of kids  things we're gonna do and things never did  'til we were stranded in that moment not sure what to say  then she broke the silence with her little shy smile  and she brought up the weather but all the while    i wondered if she thinks about jackson hole  nights beside the fire and angels in the snow  so many times i've wondered does she think of me that way    i didn't ask and she didn't say  we said our goodbyes  swore we'd stay in touch  then we went our separate ways knowing  knowing no one ever does    but i couldn't help but wonder as i walked  if thinks had turned out different where would we be today  so many times i've wondered does she think of me that way  i didn't ask and she didn't say  no  i didn't ask and she didn't say spent forty-eight dollars last night at the

more of it  i try so hard  i can't rise above it  don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'  but i like it  i love it  i want some more of it    got to wash my truck and dress up  to pick her up to watch tv  and she sits down on the sofa  she'll move a little closer  she can't get enough of me    but i like it  i love it  i want some more of it  i try so hard  i can't rise above it  don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'  but i like it  i love it  i want some more of it i couldn't help but overhear you talkin' to yourself  how she slipped right through your hands

that old cadillac  but she wasn't turnin' back  just outside of blackstaff  motor blew on her coupe deville  just in time she saw a sign  there was a texaco waitin' at the bottom of the hill    and she said "somebody must be prayin' for me  somebody out there must be prayin' for me  must be angels i can't see  somebody must be prayin' for me" yeah    a boy 'bout twenty climbed out of a truck  all covered in grease and dirt  she said "hey charles" but he just laughed  and said "i'm wearin' my daddy's shirt"  he stood there lost in her eyes  and she got lost in his  as the years roll by she would sigh  every time they kiss    and she'd say "somebody must be prayin' for me  somebody out there must be prayin' for me  must be angels i can't see  somebody must be prayin' for me"    sometimes she stares out the window  and wonders about her hollywood dreams  but when she tucks her kids in bed  she softly whispers as they fall asleep    somebody must be prayin' for me  somebody out there must be prayin' for me  ain't it funny how you always find  just what you need  somebody must be prayin' for me  somebody must be prayin' for me  prayin' for me yeah it was labor day weekend i was seventeen  i bought a coke and some gasoline  and i drove out to the county fair  and when i saw her for the first time  she was standing there in the ticket line  and it all started right then and there  oh a sailor's sky made a perfect sunset  and that's a day i'll never forget    i had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt  she was killing me in that mini-skirt  skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks  she had a sun tan line and red lipstick  i worked so hard for that first kiss  a heart don't forget something like that    it was five years later on a south-bound plane  i was headed down to new orleans  to meet some friends of mine for the mardi gras  when i heard a voice from the past  coming from a few rows back  when i looked i couldn't believe just what i saw    she said i bet you don't remember me  and i said only every other memory    i had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt  you were killing me in that mini-skirt  skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks    you had a sun tan line and red lipstick  i worked so hard for that first kiss  a heart don't forget something like that    like an old photograph  time can make a feeling fade  but the memory of the first love  never fades away    i had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt  she was killing me in that mini-skirt  skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks    she had a sun tan line and red lipstick  i worked so hard for that first kiss  a heart don't forget  no a heart don't forget  i said a heart don't forget something like that  oh  not something like that well i was southern born and raised on the good book  my old boots are worn from the hard roads i took  and i'm proud to be my daddy's son  and momma taught me how to work and not to quit  until the job's done  well i may not be high society but i got all i need  and that's just me  the only way i know to be  that's just me  what you get is what you see    well they tell me i'm old fashioned  and that i'm part of a dying breed  i'd say i'm living in real good company  but that's just me    well i got me a wife and we're bringing up a young one  well she's a backwoods woman and my boy he's a top gun  we live out in the country where we're free to roam  and when a hard day is over how i love just going home  well it's the life i live and the air i breathe    the way i believe    and that's just me  the only way i know to be  that's just me  what you get is what you see    well they tell me i'm old fashioned  and that i'm part of a dying breed  i'd say i'm living in real good company  but that's just me    yeah they tell me i'm old fashioned  and that i'm part of a dying breed  i'd say i'm living in real good company  but that's just me some people say i'm one of those guys with blessings in life overlooked  sometimes i feel like the tatter torn pages of some old paperback book  all the places i've played and the money i've made  still i've got nothing to show  and the only thing that i have left in the whole wide world is you  you put your whole life into somethin' you love and you never get that one bigbreak  gotta take you out of the back street bars and put you on center stage  but a million tears and a million beers have just about washed me up  and the only thing that i have left in the whole wide world is you    i gave it all i had every night for all these years pourin' out my soul  'til it was gone  i spread myself so thin and i'm just barely hangin' on  but tonight i'm with you and you can carry me through  just love me  'cause the only thing that i have left in the whole wide world is you  i gave it all i had every night for all these years  pourin' out my soul til it was gone  i spread myself so thin and i'm just barely hangin' on  but tonight i'm with you and you can carry me through just love me  'cause the only thing that i have left in the whole wide world is you  oh  is you if i never think about her i'll never miss her at all  never wonder what she's doing never give her a call  never see her again and i'll be free as a bird  but the trouble with never is never never works    if i never bring her flowers i'll never see her smile  if i never try to kiss her she'll never drive me wild  and i'll never feel the need to say those three little words  but the trouble with never is never never works    i know how to stay care free  let no one get a hold on me  but i can't keep my hands off her  there's somethin' different 'bout this girl    if i never let me love her i'll never settle down  and i'll never put roots in this god forsaken town  and i'll never say "i do" or step foot in a church  but the trouble with never is never never works    i know how to stay care free  let no one put a hold on me  but i can't keep my hands off her  there's somethin' different 'bout this girl    if i never think about her i'll never miss her at all  never wonder what she's doing never give her a call  never see her again and i'll be free as a bird  but the trouble with never is never never works  yeah the trouble with never is never never works  at least not with her  oh no with a trembling pen in hand i try the best i can  to write all the reasons i can't stay  and i hope she'll understand i can't leave her like a man  'cause a man would never leave her this way    a note of things i should've said  lays beside her sleeping head  as i turn and make my way off in the night  by the time the morning's breaking  my heart will still be aching  every time i think of what i've left behind    'cause i don't want to see me leaving in her eyes  and i can't stand to watch her watch me make her cry  and i don't know a right way i can do her wrong  so i don't want to be here in the morning  when she wakes up and finds me gone    it hurts to know how much she'll hurt i've told myself things could be worse  and i've convinced myself she's better off this way  by the time she finds i'm gone  i'll be a long  long way from home  when she reads a note of things i couldn't say    'cause i don't want to see me leaving in her eyes  and i can't stand to watch her watch me make her cry  and i don't know a right way i can do her wrong  so i don't want to be here in the morning  when she wakes up and finds me gone    lord i don't want to be here in the morning  when she wakes up and finds me gone six lanes tail lights  red ants marchin' into the night  they disappear to the left and right again  another supper  from a sack  a ninety nine cent heart attack  i got a poundin' head and an achin' back  and the camels buried in a big straw stack      i'm gonna live where the green grass grows  watch my corn pop up in rows  every night be tucked in close  to you  raise our kids where the good lord's blessed  point our rockin' chairs towards the west  and plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows  where the green grass grows    well i'm from  a map dot  a stop sign on a blacktop  i caught the first bus  i could hop from there  but all o' this glitter is gettin' dark  there's concrete glowin' in the city park  i don't know who my neighbors are  and there's bars on the corner and bars on my heart    i'm gonna live where the green grass grows  watch my corn pop up in rows  every night be tucked in close  to you  raise our kids where the good lord's blessed  point our rockin' chairs towards the west  and plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows  where the green grass grows    i'm gonna live where the green grass grows  watch my corn pop up in rows  every night be tucked in close  to you  raise our kids where the good lord's blessed  point our rockin' chairs towards the west  and plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows  whoa where the green grass grows she walks over to him and she says  do you remember me  i think we might've met somewhere before  southern carolina is the place that comes to mind  but hey i guess you never really can be sure    oh there's nothing like a true love  to go and make a fool of someone  just like before  and right there for a minute  i forgot that you don't love me anymore    then an old familiar feeling  wraps its arms around the moment  and he says so many times i've tried to call  well you'd think it's been a lifetime  it's been two years since i've seen you  but it seems just like no time's gone by at all    oh there's nothing like a real love  to give you back the feel of someone  just like before  and right there for a minute  i forgot that you don't love me anymore    oh and how far we'll travel  for a place to heal our hearts  we watched it unravel  to why's tonight the hardest part    then he says the weather's changin'  and it's icin' up the highway  so i guess it's time for me to hit the road  so she says good-bye and then before  she knows what she is sayin' she says  i wish you didn't have to go    oh there's nothing like a true love  to go and make a fool of someone  just like before  and right there for a minute  i forgot that you don't love me anymore  and right there for a minute  i forgot that you don't love me anymorehere we are  what is left of a husband and a wife with four good kids  who have a way of gettin on with their lives  and i'm not old but i'm getting a whole lot older every day  it's too late to keep from goin' crazy  i've got to get away    the reasons that i can't stay  don't have a thing to do with being in love  and i understand that lovin' a man shouldn't have to be this rough  and you ain't the only one who feels like this world's left you far behind  i don't know why you gotta be angry all the time    our boys are strong now  the spittin' image of you when you were young  i hope someday they can see past what you have become  i remember every time i said i'd never leave  but what i can't live with is memories of the way you used to be    the reasons that i can't stay  don't have a thing to do with being in love  i understand that lovin a man shouldn't have to be this rough  you ain't the only one who feels like this world's left you far behind  i don't know why you gotta be angry all the time    twenty years  have came and went  since i walked out of your door  i never quite made it back  to the one i was before  and god it hurts me to think of you  for the light in your eyes was gone  and sometimes i don't know why this old world can't leave well enough alone    the reasons that i can't stay  don't have a thing to do with being in love  and i understand that lovin  a man shouldn't have to be this rough  you ain't the only one who feels like this world's left you far behind  i don't know why you gotta be angry all the time [repeat x3] i was fifteen when my daddy died  mama worked two jobs just to get by  seemed like a blessing when harley came around  so she took his name  but i had my doubts  didn't take long for his drinking ways to start showing up on mama's face  one violent night  hiding under my bed  i swore that he wouldn't see another sunset  next day i followed him down to the riverbank  i knew one of us wouldn't walk away    i might have had a plan  but he didn't know it  i might have been scared  but i didn't show it  that's all between the river and me  with the current and the rocks it could have been misty  he might have been sober  but i brought the whiskey  that's all between the river and me    i walked up to him  and i said his name  just so he could see the look on my face  we stood eye to eye and toe to toe  when i told him that he wasn't gonna come back home  he raised his fist to me  but i didn't flinch  i said  "i ain't your son  you son of a bitch."    i might have had a knife in my back pocket  i might have pulled it out before he saw it  that's all between the river and me  i might have had a gun  but i didn't fire it  he might have tried to yell  but i kept him quiet  that's all between the river and me  that's all between the river and me    sheriff came knocking on our front door  they said they found his body by the reservoir  bottle in his shirt and liquor in his blood  he must have fallen in the river and he never came up    there might have been blood  but they never saw it  just a little mud on the living room carpet  that's all between the river and me  well  after what he done  there ain't no wonder  i can't remember how long i held him under  that's all between the river and me  that's all between the river and me  that's all between the river and me  that's all  that's all i am just a blank sheet of paper  this fool's about to write you a letter  to tell you that he's sorry for the way he did you wrong  to ask for your forgiveness for leaving you alone  he's been looking down at me  seems like forever  takes the top on and off his pen  it's like he can't decide just what he wants to say  if he'd just tell the truth  i'd be on my way  but he just stares at me  i just stare at him  he don't know where to start  to say he doesn't want it to end  and now it's one hour later  and i am still a blank sheet of paper    sunlight is shining through the curtains  he's almost asleep  pen in hand  there's a tear in his eye that refuses to fall  if it would land on me  that would say it all  but he just stares at me  i just stare at him  he don't know where to start  to say he doesn't want it to end  and now it's four hours later  and i am still a blank sheet of paper    and he just stares at me  i just stare at him  he don't know where to start  to say he wants it back again  and now one broken heart later  i am still a blank sheet of paper i'm so glad that i met you  baby  i'm so proud when we walk in the room  i know it's crazy to worry like i do  i get this feelin' that i'm losing you      i get these suspicions  even though i know that you love me  baby  and i really shouldn't feel this way   ooo  suspicions   i can't help it  you're just so good lookin'  i'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me    when i go out to a party with you  you always turn every head in the room  and i just know what's on every man's mind  i try to fight it  but it gets me sometimes    i get these suspicions  even though i know that you love me  baby  and i really

satisfied  the way you touch me when you lay by my side  that look in your eyes when we make love  makes me hate myself for what i'm thinkin' of    i get these suspicions  even though i know that you love me  baby  and i really shouldn't feel this way   ooo  suspicions   i can't help it  you're just so good lookin'  i'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me     suspicions   even though i

suspicions  they say not to have too much fun  they say not to get too much sun  democrat or republican  guess i'm screwed i'm neither one    don't say hell say what the heck  do what politically correct  don't pray in school but have safe sex  isn't that what they expect      who are they  yeah you know what they say  who are they  someone i gotta pay  who are they  they're probably livin' in l.a.  and i don't care anyway  who are they    they probably own the village voice  the nashville scene  the people's choice  to me it's just a bunch of noise  decided on by funny boys    they say who does and don't belong  they say our hair's too short or long  they say who's right and who's wrong  as if we'll all just come along        well i wonder if they've got a life  a broken car and two ex-wives  do they drink beer on friday night  i wonder if they like to fight    and i wonder if they've got a soul  or if they like their rock-n-roll  where do they live  i gotta know  so i can tell 'em where to go        well i don't care anyway  they're probably livin' out in l.a.  who are they  aw  you know what they say    who are they  who are they  who are they  who are they i remember sunday mornings walking on the beach  and that place we'd stop for breakfast with the old red vinyl seats  the hours of the tide chart  the way the sunlight dance upon your face    that antique roller coaster you just had to ride  i remember how you laughed at the terror in my eyes  the color and the detail  just like it was yesterday    and i remember how you held me the night my father died  i didn't have to tell you  i just broke down and cried  you're sewn into the fabric  the pieces of my life  and i just can't remember why we said goodbye    up and down this boardwalk lonely people sit  i know it wasn't perfect but nothin' ever is  the sails out in the harbor  are searching for the wind    i just had to call you  i had to hear your voice  and tell you i still love you we still have a choice  you're sewn into the fabric  the pieces of my life  and i just can't remember why we said goodbye    everything i do  leads back to you  i know i just can't let us go    there must have been a reason  but i can't remember now  i know if i could hold you we could work it out  you're sewn into the fabric the pieces of my life  and girl let's give it one more try  'cause i just can't remember why we said goodbye my mother said there's only one way  a sweet angel boy  narrow and straight  timing his past  teachings they fade  now their angel boy has gone astray    i've felt the hand of the devil  felt his breath on my skin  dip me into the water  wash me again  can i still be forgiven for all of these things  or have i gone too far now  have i lost my wings    i found a priest  i spoke my mind  asked if i'd sinned one too many times  he said "my son  you're only a man"  then i said  "sir  you don't understand"    i've felt the hand of the devil  felt his breath on my skin  dip me into the water  wash me again  can i still be forgiven for all of these things  or have i gone too far now  have i lost my wings    god help us all for what we have done  we've lost our way  we can't find the son  we make our beds  we seal our fate  is there still time  or is it too late    we've felt the hand of the devil  felt his breath our my skin  dip us into the water  wash us again  can we still be forgiven for all of these things  or have we gone too far now  have we lost our wings    we've felt the hand of the devil  felt his breath our my skin  dip us into the water  wash us again  can we still be forgiven for all of these things  or have we gone too far now  have we lost our wings    have we lost our wings i thought that was your voice  i thought that was my car  now we ain't ever met before  but i know who you are  you're living in my house  and i'm living in a tent  and don't laugh  this second job of mine  is paying both our rents  you're out here buying 'happy meals'

 all morning i'd been thinking my life's so hard  and they wore everything they owned  living in a car  i wanted to tell them it would be ok  but i just got in my suburban  and i  i drove away      i don't know why they say grown men don't cry  i don't know why they say grown men don't cry    keep having this dream about my old man  i'm ten years old and he's holding my hand  we're talking on the front porch watching the sun go down  but it was just a dream  he was a slave to his job and he couldn't be around  so many things i want to say to him  i just placed a rose on his grave and i talked to the wind        i'm sitting here with my kids and my wife and everything that i hold dear inmy life  we say grace and thank the lord  got so much to be thankful for  then its up the stairs and off to bed  and my little girl says "i haven't had my story yet"  everything weighing on my mind disappears  just like that  when she lifts her head off her pillow and says  "i love you dad"     it's been a long time  since we walked down that aisle together  and you became my wife  and who would've thought you would fall for someone just like me  for the best days of my life    i may not be a poet

me on a dime  i spent most of the next days  looking at the x-rays  talkin' 'bout the options  and talkin' 'bout sweet time"  i asked him  "when it sank in  that this might really be the real end  how's it hit you  when you get that kind of news?  man  what'd you do?"    he said  "i went skydiving  i went rocky mountain climbing  i went 2.7 seconds on a bull named fumanchu  and i loved deeper  and i spoke sweeter  and i gave forgiveness i'd been denying"  and he said  "someday i hope you get the chance  to live like you were dying"    he said  "i was finally the husband  that most of the time i wasn't  and i became a friend a friend would like to have  and all of a sudden going fishin'  wasn't such an imposition  and i went three times that year i lost my dad  i finally read the good book  and i  took a good  long  hard look  at what i'd do if i could do it all again  and then    i went skydiving  i went rocky mountain climbing  i went 2.7 seconds on a bull named fumanchu  and i loved deeper  and i spoke sweeter  and i gave forgiveness i'd been denying"  and he said  "someday i hope you get the chance  to live like you were dying  like tomorrow was a gift  and you've got eternity  to think about  what you'd do with it  what could you do with it  what did i do with it?  what would i do with it?    skydiving  i went rocky mountain climbing  i went 2.7 seconds on a bull named fumanchu  and i loved deeper  and i spoke sweeter  and i watched an eagle as it was flying"  and he said  "someday i hope you get the chance  to live like you were dying  to live like you were dying  to live like you were dying" he was thinking back when he was a kid  his folks were divorced  his old man high on something  came knocking at the door  his mama wouldn't talk to him  she said boy dontcha let him in    she was cussing and pacing and wasting her life  on that linoleum floor  he took him back to his old apartment  turned off the tv  his beautiful broken hero on the couch  passed out asleep  and he put 'em to bed  with tears in his eyes  he said dad i love you  goodbye    he headed out into the night  seventeen years old  fired up that rusty old pickup  turned his collar to the cold  and he headed back to mama's place  ready for his big escape  and he tiptoed up the stairs and left a note  in the cover's fold    it said mom i wish i could wave a wand  and make you smile again  bring back the man who stole your heart  'fore the demons got to him  if i stay here any longer  something sacred's gonna die  he said mom i love you  goodbye    took a lot of wrong turns on the road  finding his life  by the grace of god he ended up  with a little boy and a wife  and the phone call came from his sister  it was that old familiar pain  his mother was at the doorstep  of heaven's pure white light    at the end of the service  his father came up to him  clear eyed and sober now he said  boy jesus took my sins  and i pray someday maybe you'll forgive me too  with tears in his eyes  he said son i love you  goodbye    his plane touched down in texas  he pulled out his phone  dialed in the number  got the machine  of his old man's home  he said dad we got an extra room  and your grandson has your eyes  couldn't say anything else  cause he started to cry  and he choked out dad i love you  goodbye    dad i love you  goodbye there's a girl  from back roads tennessee  and she works in the factory  all day on the line  then she clocks at five finally  and there's a bar  the boys treat her like a queen  she's the bell of the ball in blue jeans  and they all get a turn  just to turn her around the floor  and they always want more    she says take me for one more song  mr. whoever you are  spin me around and pull me in close  and the band slows down  then let's get the hell out of this bar  mr. whoever you are  mr. whoever you are    they dance  melt to the heat of the song  their bodies feel like they belong  and the boys hold on tight  thinking i might get lucky tonight  and they're probably right  yeah they're probably right    she says take me for one more song  mr. whoever you are  spin me around and pull me in close  and the band slows down  then let's get the hell out of this bar  mr. whoever you are  mr. whoever you are    they hold onto her waist  she falls into the night  and she throws back her head  she looks up toward the sky  and she laughs  at all the pretty lights    and says take me for one more song  mr. whoever you are  spin me around and pull me in close  and the band slows down  let's get the hell out of this bar  mr. whoever you are  mr. whoever you are    aw mr. whoever you are  mr. whoever you are on a lover's leap with a freeway view  sittin' on my hood  thinkin' bout you  going over in my mind  every kiss and every fight  yeah the fool on the hill  is leading down another night    there were days so hard  i thought i had to go  i'd get in my car  and just follow the road  but this is my home  and it's who i am  and i know i'd stay  if i could make this old town new again    color other than blue again  i'd have something to do again  instead of thinking about you again  but the people i know  the places i go  remind me of you  oh  won't somebody come around  and make this old town new    there were nights so long  i thought the sun burned out  and there were girls so wrong  i don't want to talk about  i was burning up the night  yeah  in an alcohol flame  lightin' up my way  trying to make this old town new again    color other than blue again  i'd have something to do again  instead of thinkin' about you again  but the people i know  the places i go  remind me of you  won't somebody come around  and make this old town new    but the people i know and  the places i go  remind me of you    love goes wrong but life goes on  and i know what i gotta do  i'm just hangin' around  tryin' to make this old town new i was twenty and she was eighteen  we were just about as wild as we were green  in the ways of the world  she'd pick me up in that red rag top  we were free of the folks and hiding from the cops  on a summer night  running all the red lights  we'd park way out in a clearing in a grove  and the night was as hot as a coal-burning stove  we were cooking with gas  knew it had to last      in the back of that red rag top  she said please don't stop    well the very first time her mother met me  her green-eyed girl had been a mother-to-be  for two weeks  i was out of job and she was in school  and life was fast and the world was cruel  we were young and wild  we decided not to have the child  so we did what we did and we tried to forget  and we swore up and down there would be no regrets  in the morning light  but on the way home that night        we took one more trip around the sun  but it was all make believe in the end  and no i can't say where she is today  i can't remember who i was back then    well you do what you do and you pay for your sins  and there's no such thing as what might have been  that's a waste of time  drive you out of your mind  i was stopped at a red light just yesterday  beside a young girl in a cabriolet  and her eyes were green  and i was in an old scene      i was back in that red rag top  on the day she stopped loving me  i was back in that red rag top  on the day she stopped loving me in the fights they had he'd cover up his ears  thought big boys don't cry  fight back all the tears  mamma'd use her makeup to hide the bruises on her face  in the morning they'd pretend that there'd never ever been a trace  his old man woke him up to help him find the car  take the bus uptown outside some run down bar  he swore that he was quitting  and then he'd start to cry  and though the boy knew the truth  sometimes he'd still believe that lie    the sins of the father are the sins of the son  all you do is crawl when you want to run  god gave boys their mammas  'cause they always see their promise  and they help them understand  how to walk like man  walk like a man    they moved a lot of places  they never settled down  and it got pretty old being the new kid in town  he'd always tell his friends  "my daddy's sick today"  said he's be rich if he had a nickel every time he heard his momma say:    the sins of the father are the sins of the son  crawl before you walk boy  walk before you run  come on stand up straight  i'm proud of you  take my hand  i know you can  walk like a man  walk like a man    your daddy's demons are callin' your name  don't you listen to you 'em cause they got no claim  temptations may come that ain't no sin  you get stronger every time that you don't give in    the sins of the father are the sins of son  you can't undo what has been done  you'll have to retrace his footsteps through the sand  and pray you find the love of a girl  take her by the hand and walk on  walk like a man he sat down  picked up the phone  and said  "boy  i'm your old man"  he touched the glass between the two  as if to shake his hand    the boy  he didn't budge  not even so much as a blink  the man said  "oh  come on  better late than never  don't you think?"    he said  "i read it in the paper  can't believe you're 21  can't believe some son of mine  could do the things i hear you've done"    he went on like some big hero  who flew in to save the day  and the boy said  "if you're here  to steer me right  man  it's too late"    "you had to be there  and i'm talkin' from day one  that's the only time a man should talk  through glass to his new son"    "and you'd have to go back  and teach me how when i was nine  'cause my mama couldn't throw a ball  even if she had the time"    "and i should have been learnin' how to fish  instead of learnin' how to smoke  i bet if you'd have whooped my tail  i'd never thought it was a joke"    he said  "sometimes the will  for doin' wrong is way too strong  for any mama's prayers  you had to be there"    the man said  "boy  i'm sorry  that you hate me like you do"  the boy said  "dry it up  man  we ain't makin' this about you"    "it's about a teenage girl against the world  who was left there high and dry  about a kid who might have stood  a whole lot better shot at life"    "but you had to be there  and i'm talkin' from day one  that's the only time a man should talk  through glass to his new son"    "you'd have to go back  and teach me how when i was nine  'cause my mama couldn't throw a ball  even if she had the time"    "i should have been learnin' how to fish  instead of learnin' how to smoke  i bet if you'd have whooped my tail  i'd never thought it was a joke"    he said  "sometimes the will  for doing wrong is way too strong  for any mama's prayer  you had to be there"    before the boy hung up the phone  he said  "they say i'm out of time"  and it hit the man right there and then  "my god  son  so am i"don't you remember  the fizz in a pepper  peanuts in a bottle  at ten  two and four  a fried bologna sandwich  with mayo and tomato  sittin' round the table  don't happen much anymore    we got too complicated  it's all way over-rated  i like the old and out-dated  way of life    back when a hoe was a hoe  coke was a coke  and crack's what you were doing  when you were cracking jokes  back when a screw was a screw  the wind was all that blew  and when you said i'm down with that  well it meant you had the flu  i miss back when  i miss back when  i miss back when    i love my records  black  shiny vinyl  clicks and pops  and white noise  man they sounded fine  i had my favorite stations  the ones that played them all  country  soul and rock-and-roll  what happened to those times?    i'm readin' 'street slang for dummies'  'cause they put pop in my country  i want more for my money  the way it was back then    back when a hoe was a hoe  coke was a coke  and crack's what you were doing  when you were cracking jokes  back when a screw was a screw  the wind was all that blew  and when you said i'm down with that  well it meant you had the flu  i miss back when  i miss back when  i miss back when    give me a flat top for strumming  i want the whole world to be humming  just keep it coming  the way it was back then    back when a hoe was a hoe  coke was a coke  and crack's what you were doing  when you were cracking jokes  back when a screw was a screw  the wind was all that blew  and when you said i'm down with that  well it meant you had the flu  i miss back when  i miss back when  i miss back when we were sittin' round the supper table and the buzz of the frigidaire  was the only sound 'til momma laid down  a book she found upstairs  it was covered in dust in the back of the closet   goodwill box we almost tossed it out  we could have lost all those memories    there was a picture of mama in the pouring rain  ticket stubs to a braves game  silver star and a baggage claim from hanoi  vietnam  there was a picture of him callin' on grandpa  leather skin from a baseball  we laughed and cried  told stories all night long  from the book of john    now the pot of coffee's almost gone  as we turn another page  we're climbing on him like a jungle jim  watching his hair turn gray  all the polaroids are just reminders   you can't hold life in a three ring binder  we flipped on through 'em anyway    there's a picture at his sister taken in july  on the steps of the church pulling out his tie  hair's still wet from gettin' baptized  the brand new blue suit on  an old set of keys to his chevrolet  a crumpled up receipt for a wedding ring  we watched ourselves grow up there in his arms  in the book of john    that sun came up  we were wide awake  head to toe in black and gray  long black lincoln waiting down the drive  he was father  son  husband and friend  i still flip through it every now and then  when i need just a few words of advice  it's almost like he's not really gone  and i know one day i'll be passin' on  the book of john she said her name was a hand me down name  from the side of a family that long ago came  over here on a boat from somewhere in spain  sounded to me just a little bit strange  i guess.  but i have to admit  it felt good on my lips.    she tipped the d.j. to play her favorite song  a spanish little number that was a rockin' on strong  she grabbed me by the sleeve and said lets go and get it on  by the second chorus i was singing right along with it  i don't know what it meant  but it felt good on my lips.    oh oh oh i wanna go crazy  you can go crazy too  oh oh oh i wanna go crazy  i wanna go crazy with you    everybody sayin' whoa how sweet it is  whoa yeah it felt good on my lips    she ordered us a drink  it was a purple kind of pink  she said it's got a shot of a little bit of everything  little yellow umbrella for a fella like me  it was just a bit mellow for me to be seen with  but i took a sip  yeah it felt good on my lips    oh oh oh i wanna go crazy  you can go crazy too  oh oh oh i wanna go crazy  i wanna go crazy with you    everybody sayin' whoa how sweet it is  whoa yeah it felt good on my lips    when the lights came on and they hollered last call  i was busy getting lost in her cherry lip gloss  in a little corner booth how do i know talk  she leaned in close and gave me one long and wet  a goodnight goodbye kiss  and it felt good on my lips    whoa how sweet it is  whoa yeah it felt good on my lips  whoa how sweet it is  whoa yeah it felt good on my lips b et your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back  and i bet you got no idea you're going way too fast

 when you saw me you blushed  like you did when you were sweet sixteen.  they said you looked lost on the dance floor   with a lonely look in your eyes.  don't know why i didn't show  to this day i still don't know  for once i wish i hadn't thought twice.  then your folks split up and you moved to colorado   and i headed out to tennessee.  heard you got married and you moved back home   here we are again  you and me.    it's no surprise the light in your little girl's eyes   shines like the ring on your hand.  annie  i owe you a dance.    don't the years fly by in the blink of an eye   yeah

promise i'd take you to homecoming   but annie i didn't keep it.  almost called you up  when i played it bolder   but i thought i'd just let it be.  heard you found yourself a real good man   do you

heard him say  "one of these days you're gonna love me  you'll sit down by yourself and think  about the times you pushed and shoved me  and what good friends we might've been  and then you're gonna sigh a little  maybe even cry a little but  one of these days you're gonna love me"    patty sue was a small town beauty  i took one look at her and had to pull her to me  lord knows she should've seen right through me  when i promised her the world  but at seventeen  you only want one thing  i left her standin' there with my high school ring  innocent tears in the pourin' rain  as i walked away  and i still see her in my dreams  and to this day she's whispering    "one of these days you're gonna love me  you'll sit down by yourself and think  about the time you turned from me  and what good friends we might've been  and then you're gonna sigh a little  maybe even cry a little but  one of these days you're gonna love me"    now everybody stands up  the congregation sings  it's a song of sweet forgiveness  and as the chorus rings  the wind blows clear my memory  the pages start to turn  then suddenly i'm singin'  the moment that i learn    one of these days i'm gonna love me  and feel the joy of sweet release  one of these days  i'll rise above me  and at last i'll find some peace  then i'm gonna smile a little  maybe even laugh a little but  one of these days i'm gonna love

unspoken  i never got lost  spent years in the dark  you're here  now my heart's unbroken  no one ever left me out in the rainthe drunken clown's still hanging round  but it plain the laughter's all died down  the tears you tried so hard to hide  are flowin'  a blind man with his knife in hand  has convinced himself that he understands  i wish him well  miss carousel  but i gotta be a-goin'    won't you come and get me when  you're sure that you don't need me then  i stand outside your window  and proudly call your name    the ladies been told that all of gold  is worth so much it can't be sold  no time to weep she'll need her sleep  tomorrow  when she carries her face to the market place  and bets it on the opening race  she can ring her bells  miss carousel   but her singing brings me sorrow    it's always done every mother's son  is shown that grown men never run  and so they fight with all the might  inside them  when the battle's been fought and they all been taught  that the trick is just not being caught  will you give them hell  miss carousel   when they're begging you to hide them    when the need arose your eyes fell closed  you clamped your fingers round your nose  would you say that's any way  to judge him  you haven't got the authority  to kill him in the first degree  but would you feel compelled  miss carousel   if you have something to begrudge him    on a velvet beach far beneath the reach  of those that come to pray and preach  the natural man who tries to stand  is fallin  how long will it be before he sees  you own his legs but his mind is free  only you can tell  miss carousel   how long will he be crawling?    the castle walls has grown so tall  seem there ain't no hope at all  to reach the top even though you stop  for breathin'  but i ain't gonna try to make you cry  the tear drops couldn't find your eye  it's all been swell  miss carousel   but the time has come for leavin' why does she sing  her sad songs for me   i'm not the one  to tenderly bring  her soft sympathy  i've just begun  to see my way clear  and it's plain   if i stop i will fall  i can lay down a tear  for her pain   just a tear and that's all.    what does she want me to do?  she says that she knows  that moments are rare  i suppose that it's true  then on she goes  to say i don't care   and she knows  that i do    maybe she just has to sing  for the sake of the song  and who do i think that i am to decide that she's wrong.    she'd like to think that i'm cruel   but she knows that's a lie  for i would be  no more than a tool  if i allowed her to cry  all over me.    oh my sorrow is real  even though  i can't change my plan  if she could see how i feel  then i know  that she'd understand    oh does she actually think i'm to blame?  does she really believe  that some word of mine  can relieve  all her pain?  can't she see that she grieves  just because she's been blindly deceived  by her shame?    nothin's what it seems   maybe she'll start someday  to realize  if she abandons her dreams   then all the words she can say  are only lies  when will she see  that to gain  is only to lose?  all that she offers me  are her chains   i got to refuse    oh but it's only to herself that she's lied  she likes to pretend  it's something that she must defend   with her pride  and i don't intend  to stand her and be the friend  from whom she must hide my lover comes to me with a rose on her bosom  the moon's dancin' purple  all through her black hair  and a ladies-in-waiting she stands 'neath my window  and the sun will rise soon  on the false and the fair    she tells me she comes from my mother the mountain  her skin fits her tightly  and her lips do not lie  she silently slips from her throat a medallion  slowly she twirls it  in front of my eyes    i watch her  i love her  i long for to touch her  the satin she's wearin'  is shimmering blue  outside my window her ladies are sleeping  my dogs have gone hunting  the howling is through    so i reach for her hand and her eyes turns to poison  and her hair turns to splinters   and her flesh turns to brine  she leaps cross the room  she stands in the window  and screams that my first-born  will surely be blind    she throws herself out to the black of the nightfall  she's parted her lips  but she makes not a sound  i fly down the stairway  and i run to the garden  no trace of my true love  is there to be found    so walk these hills lightly  and watch who you're lovin'  by mother the mountain  i swear that it's true  love not a woman with hair black as midnight  and her dress made of satin  all shimmering blue she came and she touched me  with hands made of heaven  reflections sent spinnin'  through a face laced in mist  now i stand where she left me  buried deep 'neath her shadow  and the mirror plead sadly  does it all come to this  and i wonder: will she call my name?    the wind careens madly  through wide windows paneless  fragrancies mingle  in a room full of shade  the peons pick partners  and waltz cross the ceilings  but the violins whisper  that i've been betrayed  tryin not to look ashamed    the drunkards drink deeply  from cups full of nothingness  ghost lovers laugh  at the games that they play  the moments do somersaults  into eternity  cling to their coattails  and beg them to stay  saying i got nothing to hide    illusions projected  on walls made of tiffany  mad minuets to  a sad satin song  a harlequin mandolins  harmonize helplessly  hoping that endlessly  won't last for long  praying that their god ain't dying    then i turn and i see her  in a dress made of moonlight  teardrops like diamonds  run slow down her face  her arms surround me  like chains made of velvet  and the demons fall faithfully  into their place  and the rivers run with jewels    now the morning lies open  the night went quite quickly  memory harmlessly  fractures and fades  all the poets do push-ups  on carpets of rubber foam  loudly they laugh  at some joke that's been made  and the wise men speak like fools like silent she stands  like laughter she falls  from a castle of sand  like a memory she crawls  and the mockingbirds grieve  'cause they can't make her cry  they'll soon start to believe  that the lady has died  what it all goes to show  it ain't my job to say  for who am i to know  why she's actin' this way    once again turn away  if you're sure that it's done  tell your prophets to pray  tell your bandits to run  take your eyelids of stone  they won't do you no harm  take your cross made of bones  take your your fly-paper arms  and when everything's placed  in your coffin and go  through a scarf 'round your face  'cause the subway gets cold  pack up your sunflower smile  and your bandana blues  take your worthless denials  they're all you've got left to lose  take your tinkerbell lies  and your weary desires  take the tears in your eyes  take your cup full of fire  give your lover a call  if your legs start to fail  and he'll come break your fall  with a bed full of nails    no need to glance back again  there ain't nothin' to see  just this drunken old man  and this woman and me  and you've made it quite plain  that we're just wastin' time  and you say that it seems strange  that i'm staying behind  but you don't worry 'bout me  i can make it alone  'cause i got no place to be  and i ain't far from homeamong the strangest things i ever heard  was when a friend of mine said "man  let's get some thunderbird"  i said "what's that?" he just started to grin  slobbered on his shirt  his eyes got dim  he said "you got fifty-nine cents?"    i said "yeah  i got a dollar  but don't be a smartalec  i ain't gonna spend it on no indian relic"  and he said "thunderbird's not an old indian trinket   it's a wine  man  you take it home and drink it."  i said "it sure don't sound like wine to me"  and he said he'd bet me the change from my dollar    we hustled on down to the nearest you-tate-um  the guy wanted my id  i whipped her out and showed him  he got a green bottle from the freezing vault  my friend started doing backward somersaults  through the cottage cheese    took it back to his house  started drinkin'  pretty soon i set in to thinkin'  "man  this thunderbird tastes yummy  yummy  yummy  and i know it's doing good things to my tummy  tum  t"  it's so you reason when your on that crap    got a few more bottles  chugged them down  i pulled myself up off the ground  decided i go see my dearest sweet wife  who met me at the door with a carving knife  said "get them damn grape peel from between your teeth."    i could see we're gonna have a little misunderstanding  i said "dear  i better get in touch with you later"  she said "forget it  man  you're never touchin' me

"kid  we don't much like the way you walk  and you gonna have to change the way you talk"  they said "your dress is kind of sludge  and your attitude is mighty grudge"  said "you got to learn to bubble"  "you got to bubble with enthusiasm" i started bubble  "most important thing you can't forget  is learning the entire greek alphabet"  i never did really understand  that that's gonna make me anymore a man  but i learned it  i can whip through that son-of-a-beta backwards in five seconds  then they hit me with some pretty bad news  concerning the payment of monthly dues  i never did know where that money went  i never was sure it was well spent  but i paid it  i'm no trouble causer and besides i figured that's life  if you want good friends it gonna cost you    well  finally got to be party time  i got a great big old jug of wine  i went back to the house in about an hour  when the boy's were drinking whiskey sours  brandy alexanders  frozen daquires  reciting the greek alphabet to one another    i could see i was gonna have to do my very best  to get myself out of that fraternity mess  i stood right there outside the door  and i chugged that wine like never before  walked inside and bubbled  all over a couple of their dates    so now everything's back to normal again  but there is still lots of room for improvement my friend  'cause that fraternity stuff is too much

greedy vapors  'til his long  green eyes did glow  mud was left with the sighs and trembles  watching his hard earned money go    flushes fell on gold like water  tens they paired and paired again  but the aces only flew through heaven  and the diamond jack called no man friend  the diamond queen saw muds ordeal  began to think of her long lost son  fell to her knees with a mother's mercy  prayed to the angels every one    the diamond queen  she prayed and prayed  and the diamond angel filled muds hole  the wicked king of clubs himself  fell in face down in front of gold  now three kings come to clubs command  but the angels from the sky did ride  three kings up on the streets of gold  three fireballs on the muddy side    the club queen heard her husband's call  but lord that queen of diamond's joy  when the outlaw in the heavenly hall  turned out to be a wandering boy  now mud he checked and gold bet all  and mud he raised and gold did call  and the smile just melted off

the last  the deeds that rang our youthful dreams  it seems shall go undone  north for the shores of valinor  our bows and crimson sails were made  our captains were strong  our lances long  and our liege the holy king    the hills did turn from green to blue  and vanish as on the decks we watched  but every thought in that noble company  was forward bound  to the lifeless plains of valinor  where reigns the dark and frozen one  and with tongues afire and glorious eyes  we pledged our mission be    the clime from mild to bitter ran  the wind from fair to fierce did blow  oath and prayer did turn to thoughts  of homes left far behind  longed every man for some glimpse of land  and the host that did await us there  but each new day brought only a sea  and sky of ice and gray    thanks give no word can drag you through  those endless weeks our ships did roll  thanks give you cannot see those sails  and faces bleach and draw  ice we drank and leather did chew  for the oceans are unwholesome there  the dead that slid into the seas  did freeze before our eyes    then a wind did fling the ships apart  each one to go her separate way  the sky did howl  the hull did groan  for how long i do not know  and what men were left when the winds had ceased  grew dull and low of countenance  for soldiers denied their battle plain  on comrades soon must turn    so one by one we died alone  some by hunger  some by steel  bodies froze where they did fall  their souls unsanctified  until only another and i were left  then just before his flame did fail  we shone ourselves brothers-in-arms  to serve the holy king    perhaps this shall reach andilar  although i know not how it can  for once again he's hurled his wind  upon the silver prow  but if it should my words are these  arise young men fine ships to build  and set them north for valinor  'neath standards proud as fire well  the birds were talking all at once  and the old man mowing down his lawn  he didn't look like much too bad a guy  and i was thinkin' hang on  man  something's wrong  your blues seems to be gone  heaven ain't bad but you don't get nothing done.    lay down your head a while  you are not needed now  you are not needed now    well  allison laid a hex on me  and every time i turn around  it's swimming through the air above my bed  i told miss higgs and she said fine  as long as

awhile  well he dug her up and he dug her down  'fore too long he found some bones  poor little billy couldn't make a sound  when the bones sat up and smiled    oh billy you seem like a fine young man  no reason to be a tremblin' soul  come over here and shake my hand  make my proud acquaintance  well billy he was stunned he could hardly stand  whether he could move he didn't know  but he knew he had to formulate some kinda plan  or try the boneman's patience    the first thing he wanted to do was breathe  so he gulped in some of that battleground air  next thing he wanted to do was leave  but billy wasn't raised up rude  well the boneman grunted and he gave a heave  all of a sudden he was loomin' there  shakin' off dirt and actin' pleased  things didn't look too good    well billy decided

every little thing  is understood  between martin and me.    he is a good friend   and he has his own voice.  and you get what you give   sometimes it's just noise.  but if you treat him well  he will last your life long.  and if you're honest and open  well  he will write you a song.   write you a song  write you a song     stronger than steel and wood.  seen me through the bad and good.  and when
