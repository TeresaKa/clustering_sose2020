be mad  to be yours alone!  grand tosee your face  feel your touch   hear your voice say i'm all your own.    i didn't know what time it was  live was no prize.  i wanted love and here it was  shining out of your eyes.  i'm wise   and i know what time it is now.    once i was old  twenty years or so  rather well preserved   the wrinkles didn't show.  once i was old   but not too old for fun.  i used to hunt for little girls  up my imaginary gun.  but now i ain't for only one!    i didn't know what time it was  then i met you.  oh  what a lovely time it was   how sublime it was too!  i didn't

wound up rotten the water for all the teams.    well  there ain't nobody gonna miss me when i'm leavin'  there ain't nobody ever loved me very long  no matter how much i miss our show  i get kicked around everywhere i go  there ain't nobody gonna miss me when i'm gone.    so when my uncle sam called me to serve my country  i stood up brave and smiled and packed my duds  but to my surprise when i got there  they gave me the boots and cut my hair  i wound up scrubbin' the floor and a peelin' spuds.    no  ain't nobody gonna miss me when i'm leavin'  there ain't nobody ever loved me very long  no matter how much i miss our show  i get kicked everywhere i go  there ain't nobody gonna miss me when i'm gone.    well  i met me a pretty little girl one day in nashville  i loved her more than all of my wildest dreams  she took me for my money  my house and my boat  and didn't even leave me a goodbye note  i gave it all up  boy  did she strip me clean.    well  there ain't nobody gonna miss me when i'm leavin'  there ain't nobody ever loved me very long  no matter how much i miss our show  i get kicked around everywhere where i go  there ain't nobody gonna miss me when i'm gone  when i'm

didn't take long us leavin' but i thought we'd never arrive  now we get more rides than hitches as we hitch hiked along  i got sore feet and blisters and billy ray wrote a song.    billy ray wrote a song about everything we did  i was a-findin' fault he was findin' rhyms that fit?  well  we did a lot of thinkin' most of my thoughts were wrong  i wanted to ride to nashville but billy ray wrote a song.    well  we got into nashville tired  a-hungry and cold  if we'd had a dime between us we could a-called everybody we know  we found a bar still open a little band was pickin' away  and i set in

frightened by a shotgun  they say  that's why i'm such a wonderful shot.  i'd be out in the cactus and i'd practice all day   and now tell me what have i got?  i'm quick on the trigger with targets not much bigger than a pinpoint  i'm number one  but my score with a feller  is lower than a celler  oh you can't get a man with a gun.  when i'm with a pistol  i sparkle like a crystal  yes  i shine like the morning sun   but i lose all my luster  when with a bronco buster   oh you can't get a man with a gun.  with a gu-un  with a gu-un  oh you can't get a man with a gun  if i went to battle with someone's herd of cattle  you'd have steak when the job was done.  but  if i shot the herder  they'd holler bloody murder  and you can't shoot a male in the tail like a quail   oh you can't get a man with a gun.  i'm cool  brave  and daring to see a lion glaring  when i'm out with my remington.  but a look from a mister will raise a fever blister  oh you can't get a man with a gun  the gals with umbrellas are always out with fellers  in the rain or the blazin sun  but a man never trifles with gals who carry rifles  oh you can't get a man with a gun.  with a gu-un  with a gu-un  oh you can't get a man with a gun.  a man's love is mighty  he'll even buy a nightie  for a gal who he thinks is fun.  but they don't buy pajamas for pistol packin mamas  and you can't get a hug from a mug  with a slug  oh you can't get a man with a gun.[intro]  oh right  oh  oh why  na-da-da-da    [hook]  i keep my head high  i got my wings to carry me  i don't know freedom  i want my dreams to rescue me  i

born suzanne takes you down to her place near the river  you can hear the boats go by  you can spend the night beside her  and you know that she's half crazy  but that's why you want to be there  and she feeds you tea and oranges  that come all the way from china    and just when you mean to tell her  that you have no love to give her  then she gets you on her wavelength  and she lets the river answer    that you've always been her lover  and you want to travel with her  and you want to travel blind  and you know that she will trust you  for you've touched her perfect body with your mind.    and jesus was a sailor  when he walked upon the water  and he spent a long time watching  from his lonely wooden tower    and when he knew for certain  only drowning men could see him  he said "all men will be sailors then  until the sea shall free them"    but he himself was broken  long before the sky would open  forsaken  almost human  he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone    and you want to travel with him  and you want to travel blind  and you think maybe you'll trust him  for he's touched your perfect body with his mind.    now suzanne takes your hand  and she leads you to the river  she is wearing rags and feathers  from salvation army counters    and the sun pours down like honey  on our lady of the harbour  and she shows you where to look  among the garbage and the flowers    there are heroes in the seaweed  there are children in the morning  they are leaning out for love  and they will lean that way forever    while suzanne holds the mirror  and you want to travel with her  and you want to travel blind  and you know that you can trust her  for she's touched your perfect body with her mind. old people talk to themselves  when they sit all 'round all day  this old woman i knew  i used to go over there and sit with her  and she'd be sitting around  in a rocking chair talking to herself    and she used to say she used to say  sometimes the cold gets in my bones so bad  till i just don't think i can go  yeah and for a little while well i don't care  if my days are coming to an end  and just as soon be gone sometimes    sometimes the night comes down on me  and i know what's ahead  an evening in this cold old house  with no one to say goodnight to me when i go to bed  an evening in this cold old house  with no one to say goodnight to me when i go to bed    sometimes  i wonder why i stay  what am i waiting for  my children are grown and gone away  they got children of their own now  don't need me anymore    in winter when the streets are bare  there ain't nothing much to see  i just can't help missing and thinking  about that kindly man  that one old winter time came  and took away from me    and then one morning  another spring is there outside my door  things are blooming  birds are singing  and suddenly yes well i ain't sad  ain't sad no more ain't sad no more    when it's warm and the sun is out  it's like my heart's restored  i've had my

"hold it bud  i don't play that game"  i reached in my pocket  and to her big surprise  there was lincoln staring her dead in the eyes.  on a greenback  greenback dollar bill  just a little piece of paper  coated with chlorophyll  she looked at me with that familiar desire  her eyes lit up like they were on fire  she said  "my name's flo  and you're on the right track  but look here  daddy  i wear furs on my back  so if you want to have fun in this man's land  let lincoln and jackson start shaking hands"  on a greenback  greenback dollar bill  just a little piece of paper  coated with chlorophyll  i didn't know what i was getting into  but i popped lincoln and jackson  too  i didn't mind seeing them fade out of sight  i just knew i'd have some fun last night  whenever you in town and looking for a thrill  if lincoln can't get it  jackson sure will  on a greenback  greenback dollar bill  just a little piece of paper  coated with chlorophyll  we went to a nightspot where the lights were low  dined and danced  and i was ready to go  i got out of my seat  and when flo arose  she said  "hold on daddy  while i powder my nose"  i sat back down with a smiling face  while she went down to the powder place  with my greenback  greenback dollar bill  just a little piece of paper  coated with chlorophyll  the music stopped and the lights came on  i looked around and saw i was all alone  i didn't know how long flo had been gone  but a nose powder sure didn't take that long  i left the place with tears in my eyes  as i waved lincoln and jackson a last goodbye  on a greenback  greenback dollar bill  just a little piece of paper  coated with chlorophyll well you better listen my sisters and brothers  'cause if you do you can hear  there are voices still calling across the years  and they're all crying across the ocean  and they're crying across the land  and they will till we all come to understand  none of us are free  none of us are free  none of us are free  one of us are chained  none of us are free  and there are people still in darkness  and they just can't see the light  if you don't say it's wrong then that says it right  we got try to feel for each other  let our brothers know that we care  got to get the message  send it out loud and clear  none of us are free  none of us are free  none of us are free  one of us are chained  none of us are free  it's a simple truth we all need  just to hear and to see  none of us are free  one of us is chained  none of us are free  now i swear your salvation isn't too hard too find  none of us can find it on our own  we've got to join together in spirit  heart and mind  so that every soul who's suffering will know they're not alone  none of us are free  none of us are free  none of us are free  one of us are chained  none of us are free  if you just look around you  you're gonna see what i say  'cause the world is getting smaller each passing day  now it's time to start making changes  and it's time for us all to realize  that the truth is shining real bright right before our eyes  none of us are free  none of us are free  none of us are free  one of us are chained  none of us are free  none of us are free  none of us are free  none of us are free  one of us are chained  none of us are free  none of us are free  none of us are free  none of us are free  one of us are chained  none of us are

sitting at home in my bed too long  got my things and now i'm gone  how's the world gonna from take me?  finding myself used to be hard  but now i see the light  if love is a drug  then i don't need it  i've been on the shelf too long  sitting at home in my bed too long  now it's time to hear my song  how are you gonna take it?  i've been on the shelf too long  think the words without the song  never had a way to go  tell me now i'm taking it  i've been on the shelf too long  i've been on the shelf too long  i've been on the shelf too long  we've got a lot of living to do  there's a door in my mind that's open wide  come inside come inside  jesus never saved me  he'll never save you too  and you know!  i've got a little sticker on the back of my boot  this is music  and now i see the light shining bright in my eyes  if love is the drug then it ain't for me  well music is my life  and loved by me  i'm gonna move on the floor with my sweet young thing  down down down we go till we reach the bottom  of our soul with this is music
