baby  i love to love you baby  i love to love you baby  i love to love you baby spoken:  you know tonight is a very important night  for me for a number of reasons  my little girl is here tonight  and i don't think you understand  what it's like being the daughter of  someone who's always gone  it's kind of scary and it's kind of lonely  and i guess she thinks to herself sometimes  "is mummy ever going ever gonna come home?"  and so my daughter looked up at me  last week and she said "mummy  when are you just gonna stay home  one day and be with me"?  and so it kinda struck me funny  and i didn't realize that i hadn't spent  anytime with her for a long time  so i sat down and wrote down this song  after she went to bed  and i told her tonight when it was bedtime  i would sing her son  i bet you ask yourself  why i'm never there  it's not because i like being away  you see i've made a spectacle of myself  and it seems that the whole world needs me  i understand when you cry alone  and mama's not there to wipe your eyes  you see it's only because  i'm out being someone to make you cry  i got a little letter  and i read it on the plane  and in my heart i felt a funny kind of pain  i wish that i could be there  to touch your face again  mimi you're beautiful  mimi you're mine  and other things that i do in my life  seem to take up all your precious time  there's so much i long to say  so much more i long to do  but i guess it's all just have to wait  till i can get to see you  mimi you're mine  oh  mimi you're mine  oh  mimi you fill my life  you fill my life with so much love  cause you're beautiful  and you love me  and you'll understand  mimi it's bedtime say goodnight  "goodnight"   spoken:  i just wanna say this  this is something i thing most of you ladies will identify with  and maybe some of you men too   the man i love   someday he'll come along  the man i love  and he'll be rich and strong  the man i love  and when he comes my way  i'll do my best to make him stay  he'll look at me and smile  i'll understand  and maybe for awhile  he'll take my hand  and though it seems absurd  i know we both won't say a word  spoken:  you know i'm the kind of lady  that always seems to find the wrong man  at the wrong place at the wrong time  it's not that i go out looking for him  but somehow he always seems to find me  you see what i'm looking for is the kind of man  that comes home with candy  and flowers sayin' "come on put on your dancing shoes  cause we're gonna wine and dine  wine and dine"  but what i always seem to find is the kind of man  that comes home fussing  and fighting  breaking my best dishes  and beat my head outside the wall  shows no love no respect and nothing at all   i got it bad and that ain't good   never treats me sweet and gentle  the way he should  i got it bad and that ain't good!   no  it ain't good at all  you know   spoken:  listen  have you been treating your lady nice lately  you have?  and how about you?  great  well i've been gettin' rocked completely!  my poor heart is sentimental it's not made of wood  i got it bad and that ain't good  spoken:  so you see on monday nights  i just go out and drink and drink  but when the weekend's over on monday rolls aroun'  i end up like i start out just cryin' my heart out  cryin' my heart out  lord above me  come on  make him love me  then he should  i got it bad baby  i got it bad baby  i got it bad and that ain't good!  no it ain't good at all you know  spoken:  but listen mister big shot i've got your number  and i'll take care of you  and you too and you and you and you   some of these days   some of these days  you're gonna miss your donna  some of these days  you're gonna feel so lonely  you'll miss my huggin'  you'll miss my kissin'  you'll miss me honey  when you're far away  you're gonna be so lonely  for me only  cause you know daddy  you had you way  and if i leave you  you know it's gonna grieve you  you're gonna miss your sweet lovin' donna  some of these days  and if i leave you  you know it's gonna grieve you  you're gonna miss your sweet little donna  some of these days  hey honey call me when you got time  know what i mean...   someone found a letter you wrote me  on the radio  and they told the world just how you felt  it must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat  they never said your name  but i knew just who they meant.    whoa i was so surprised and shocked  and i wondered  too  if by chance you heard it for yourself  i never told a soul just how i've been feeling over you  but they said it really loud  they said it on the air    on the radio  whoa  oh  oh  on the radio  whoa oh oh oh  on the radio  whoa  oh  oh  on the radio  whoa  oh  oh    now  now  don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song  things are not the same since we broke up last june  the only thing that i want to hear is that you love me still  and that you think you'll be comin' home real soon    whoa  oh  yeah  yeah  and it made me feel proud when i heard you say  you couldn't find the words to say it yourself  and now in my heart i know i can say what i really feel  'cause they said it really loud  they said it on the air    on the radio  whoa  oh  oh  on the radio  whoa  oh  oh  on the radio  whoa  oh  oh  on the radio  whoa oh oh  on the radio    if you think that love isn't found on the radio  well tune right in you made find the love you lost  'cause now i'm sitting here with the man i sent away long ago  it sounded really loud   they said it really loud    on the radio  whoa  oh  oh  on the radio  whoa  oh  oh  on the radio  whoa  oh  oh  on the radio  whoa  oh  oh  on the radio if i had known of what would come  i might have walked outta here a lot less harmed  but i'm no lady of the glass  and i can't foretell what will pass    and i went with my defenses down  as your love sent me spinning spinning 'round  oh you took me to the very top  and then i took a bad  and  long long

of it's own  it holds our lives together  you're my heart and you're my home  stayed awake last night  told myself that this time we were through  that passion wasn't pain  my heart had changed  but then in the morning light  the feeling cut me like a knife  and then i knew  i couldn't walk away from you 'cause  love has a mind of its own  it moves in it's own circles  and it roams where it will roam  love has a mind of it's own  it holds our lives together  you're my heart and you're my home  oh  we can drive ourselves so far apart  till the world gets in between  before you know  the distance grows  till never we lose sight of the dream  but the wonder of it all  is our love will survive  it never fails to keep us going  it never fails to keep us alive  love has a mind of its own  it moves in it's own circles  and it roams where it will roam  love has a mind of it's own  it holds our lives together  you're my heart and you're my home  love has a mind of its own  it moves in it's own circles  and it roams where it will roam  love has a mind of it's own  it holds our lives together  you're my heart and you're my home   hung around with big shots  never knew love was in the

[chorus: x2]    [repeat: x2]  do you know  do you know  do you know  do you know  do ya i don't have to tell you  what this is all about  'cause baby half the fun  is in us figuring it all out    so why you gotta ask me  what i'm doing now  'cause i don't like to question  what i still haven't found    so don't turn off the lights  i don't want to be  in the dark tonight  'cause i can't read your mind  i need to know if  what i'm doing is right  so don't turn off the lights  so don't turn off the lights    so tell me how  we're gonna get there  it's hard to even try  but if we move together  we'll end up on the same side    so don't turn off the lights  i don't want to be  in the dark tonight  'cause i can't read your mind  i need to know if  what i'm doing is right  so don't turn off the lights  so don't turn off the lights    if you could know  what i'm feeling  would you run and  where would you go  if you want to know  what i'm thinking  then just turn on the lights  and you'll know    so don't turn off the lights  i don't want to be  in the dark tonight  'cause i can't read your mind  i need to know if  what i'm doing is right  so don't turn off the lights    so don't turn off the lights  i don't want to be  in the dark tonight  'cause i can't read your mind  i need to know if  what i'm doing is right  so don't turn off the lights  so don't turn off the lights  so don't turn off the lights  so don't turn off the lights     don't turn off the lights  they say love is just a game  they say time can heal the pain  sometimes you win  sometimes you lose  and i guess i'm just a fool  i keep holding on to you    i told you once you were the one  you know that i die for you  oh  though it hurts to see you go  oh  this time you should know  i won't try to stop you    don't you forget about me baby  don't you forget about me now  some day you'll turn around and ask me  why did i let you go    so you try to fake a smile  you don't wanna break my heart  i can see that you're afraid  but baby it's to late  'cause i'm already dying    don't you forget about me baby  don't you forget about me now  some day you'll turn around and ask me  why did i let you go    don't you forget about me baby  don't you forget about me now  some day you'll turn around and ask me  why did i let you go    why did i let you    don't you forget about me baby  don't you forget about me now  some day you'll turn around and ask me  why did i let you go    why did i let you go    wherever i go  i won't forget about you  oh no  no  no  wherever you go  don't you forget about me you can run you can hide  but you can't escape my love  you can run you can hide  but you can't escape my love    here's how it goes  you and me  up and down  but maybe this time  we'll get it right  worth the fight  cause love isn't something you can shake    when it breaks all it takes is some trying    if you feel like leaving  i'm not going to make you stay  but soon you'll be finding  you can

you make me feel like a kid  in a movie  i know that you love me  like the sound of the sea rush in to shore  the air that i breathe fills me with your love  i've wasted a thousand nights  for comfort in the arms of a stranger  i thought it would lead me  on to bigger  brighter things  but you know that i'm wrong  it doesn't exist and you make  me feel like a kid in a movie  i know that you love me  like the sound of the sea rush in to shore  the air that i breathe fills me with your love  like the clouds in the sky  the rain falling down  washes my feet  pulls me to the ground  i'm begging you please  never to leave me  i know you believe  you know what i've said and done  like the sound of the sea rushes to shore  the air that i breathe fills me with your love  like the clouds in the sky

see the city light  wind was blowing  time stood still  eagle flew out of the night  he was something to observe  came in close  i heard a voice  standing stretching every nerve  i had to listen had no choice  i did not believe the information  just had to trust imagination  my heart was going boom boom  boom  "son " he said  "grab your things  i've come to take you home."  to keeping silence i resigned  my friends would think i was a nut  turning water into wine  open doors would soon be shut  so i went from day to day  tho' my life was in a rut  'till i thought of what i'd say  which connection i should cut  i was feeling part of the scenery  i walked right out of the machinery  my heart was going boom boom boom  "hey " he said  "grab your things  i've come to take you home."  yeah back home  when illusion spin her net  i'm never where i want to be  and liberty she pirouette  when i think that i am free  watched by empty silhouettes  who close their eyes  but still can see  no one taught them etiquette  i will show another me  today i don't need a replacement  i'll tell them what the smile on my face meant  my heart was going boom boom boom  "hey " i said  "you can keep my things  they've come to take me home."     i'm just saying  i want my mummy back  lost her to the drink  but her soul's intact  mama said to me  be proud of who you are  she saw jesus in the eyes  of a broken man    sail away  i am learning my lesson  mama sends her love  and godspeed you come home soon    one little white lie was enough  to conceal my goodbye  then i stole away  kissed her farewell  and wished her the best for life  then i stole away  whoa  like a thief in the night    i'm just saying  not behind daddy's back  he takes care of her  in his overtime  he's no saint i know  as he goes around the town  watch him cry himself to sleep  he's my daddy    sail away  i will go it alone now  leave my past behind  to seek fortune and fame    one little white lie was enough  to conceal my goodbye  then i stole away  kissed her farewell  and wished her the best for life  then i stole away  whoa  like a thief in the night    sail away  there's a storm in a teacup  mama sends her love  and godspeed you come home    one little white lie was enough  to conceal my goodbye  then i stole away  kissed her farewell  and wished her the best for life  then i stole away  whoa  like

you would always get so sensitive  and try to turn your transgressions into my guiltiness  but now i'm certain of the way i live  and what i'm responsible for in this twisted game    and it's such a shame  that you try to make pain  another word for my name  whether giving or receiving  it's one the same  just one more link  in your long-ass chain  but it's time to break  this frame and my strengthful will  time to jump off this negative cycle we've built  gave my heart  but my self-respection you won't steal  now it's time to let ya know if you can hear me feel me    ah  ah ah  ah ah

asked him again  came two little consensus from all them opinions  that life is too short to be unhappy  and since i know what i'm worth there'll be no settling for dirt  knowing what i deserve is gold  if i want diamonds then i can't settle for coal    maybe i was just too strong to let go  maybe i was just too weak to let it show  maybe i was just too stubborn to say "no"  but whatever the case i can't take it no more    ah  ah ah  ah ah ah  ahhhh ah ah  ah ah ah  ah  ah ah  ah ah ah  ahhhh ah ah  ah ah ah    ah  ah ah  ah ah ah  ahhhh ah ah  ah ah ah  ah  ah ah  ah ah ah  ahhhh ah ah  ah ah ah    ah  ah ah  ah ah ah  ahhhh ah ah  ah ah ah  ah  ah ah  ah ah ah  ahhhh ah ah  ah ah ah    sometimes i think maybe we'll patch it all up  like a favourite pair of jeans that you won't give

watching the wildlife  we walk the water like a sun  living cuts you like a knife  living here watching the wildlife    get in love  get in lovei was alone not long ago  without a love to call my own.  i was afraid and thought  it wasn't meant for me.  i didn't need anybody else  that was what i would tell myself.  and i believed that was how it would be.    i used to think that i was fine.  oh  that i was doing ok.  i didn't know that i was blind.  i just went on along my way.  i didn't know what i was missing  'til i felt you tender lips  kissing my fears away.  i'm so glad you're here today.    i never had somebody i could lean on.  i never had a shoulder i could cry on  'til i found you babe -  'til i found you.  and i never had somebody i would think about.  i never had someone i coudln't do without  'til i found you babe -  'til i found you.    i had been badly hurt before.  eversince then  i would ignore  any chance for love -  i thought it was a lie.  i learned to rely on myself  and i thought that i was doin' well  until you came with something  i just can't deny.    i used to think that i was fine oh   i was doing alright.  i would go on and do my thing  everyday and every night.  i didn't know what i was missin'  'til i felt your tender love  fillin' me up inside.  i love you with all my might.     and i never knew how good a love could feel  'til i found you babe  wooh.  and i never thought a love could be so real  'til i found you.  while the world keeps turning round and round  while i feel i just can't hear a sound  i hear your name... i hear your name  i try to go back to my usual day  i try to slip back to my usual ways  but its not the same  i'm not the same  refrain i  don't you know that love is the voice  that whispers each time i try to hide it  i've lost all control  i'm helpless inside  and you'll see it in my eyes  you know  chorus  you've taken over me   my baby now you've taken over my heart  you've taken over me   my baby now you've taken over my heart  from the start...  i've never felt this way for anyone  my security has come undone  and i feel alive... i feel alive  to a place i've never been before  when you came  you opened up the door  and it feels so right  it feels so right...  refrain ii  i did'nt know that love would be here  but now that you've come  i just can't fight it  and now it's so clear  with this feeling inside  there's no need to ask why... because   repeat chorus   bridge  whatever you want is my command  now that's how i feel  it's like whatever you wish for  i will grant  and the feeling is oh so real...   adlib    repeat chorus till fade  i everyone has a friend of their own  someone that we can look up to  mine is like no one i've ever known  he's not like me  he's not like you  ii while you and i climb the ladder high  he looks into the horizon  he asks me " boy  what are you tryin' to find? "  then i realize my journey's just begun...  chorus i  everybody  say "hello" to this friend of mine  he's standing here  right inside of me  and everybody  he's the one who's always on my mind  he's somebody you don't see...  iii knowing what's good  and what is right from wrong  he always seeks to find it  the choice between coin and candy for the soul  he needs nobody to remind him  iv he always packs his bag with honesty  specially to show to himself  a tank-full of courage and humility  so he won't get lost  tryin' to be somebody else  chorus ii  everybody  say " hello" to this friend of mine  he's standing here  right inside of me  and everybody  he's the one who's always on my mind  he's somebody you don't see...  his name is mr. what- i - wanna - be  his name is mr. what- i - wanna - be  bridge  and the race goes on  and on  and on  the race for truth in a world of lies  life is not just what we have known  in a world full of blindness   now i wanna see with both my

heart of gold  and she's alone  garden eden is her home  she's like a storm  she's like a star  you think she's near  but she so far  she's like the sun in wintertime  she's hard to find    she's the witch queen of eldorado  high on the mountain  heya heya heya hoh  for the freedom in eldorado  she's the fountain  heya heya heya hoh  she's the witch queen of eldorado  lady of fire - heya heya heya heya hoh  and she fighting for eldorado  with her desire - heya heya heya heya hoh    she is warming frozen roses - gives you dreams  money can't buy - in the desert of eldorado  all your dreams will learn to you    she's justified in wounded knee  some lies are true  oh can't you see  follow the sun  and you will find  a secret room  just in your mind  let's make this world  a better place  for the human race    love can move the greatest mountain  and all your love comes back to you  in the desert of eldorado  oh some dreams are coming true    walk on water - walk on fire  the wind must come  from somewhere  in the desert of eldorado  there is the answer  oh take careit's still getting worse after everything i tried.  what if i found a way to wash it all aside.  what if she touches with those fingertips.  as the words spill out like fire from her lips.      if she says come inside i'll come inside for her.  if she says give it all i'll give everything to her.  i am justified.  i am purified.  i am sanctified.    inside you  heaven's just a rumor she'll dispel.  as she walks me through the nicest parts of hell.  i still dream of lips i never should have never kissed.  well she knows exactly what i can't resist        i think we should get in the front right now   get in the front right now!  doesn't that feel good?  now you're ready to go  get it.  now i want you to get in there and get the job done.  life is great!  life is terrific!  thank you god for another wonderful day!  i'm still caught up in another of her spells.  well she's turning me into someone else.  everyday i hope and pray this will end.  but when i can i do it all again  and if she says come inside i'll come inside for her.  if she says give it all i'll give everything to her.  i am justified.  i am purified.  i am sanctified.  inside you  i am purified.  i am terrified.  i am sanctified.  inside you  even when it's bowling shapes and see your life begin to change. kinda like a cloud i was up way up in the sky.  and i was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe.  sometimes i don't believe them myself and i decided i was never coming down.  just then a tiny little dot caught my eye.  it was just about too small to see.  but i watched it way too long.  that dot was pulling me down.      i was up above it.  i was up above it.  i was up above it.  i was up above it.  now i'm down in it  shut up.    so what what does it matter now.  i was swimming in the hate now i crawl on the ground.  and everything i never liked about you is kind of seeping into me.  i try to laugh about it now but isn't it funny how everything works out.  i guess the jokes on me.        i used to be so big and strong.  i used to know my right from wrong.  i used to never be afraid.  i used to be somebody.  i used to have something inside.  now just this hole it's open wide.  used to want it all.  i used to be somebody.  i'll cross my heart and hope to die.  but the needle's already in my eye.  and all the world's weight is on my back and i don't even know why.  and what i used to think was me is just a fading memory.  i looked him right in the eye and said "goodbye."        rain rain go away.  come

heard  just might be true  and you know me   well you think you do   sometimes  i have everything - yet i wish i felt something    do you know how far this has gone?  just how damaged have i become?  when i think i can overcome  it runs even deeper    and in a dream i'm a different me  with a perfect you  we fit perfectly  and for once in my life i feel complete  and i still want to ruin it  afraid to look  as clear as day  this plan has long been underway    i hear them call  i cannot stay  the voice inviting me away    do you know how far this has gone?  just how damaged have i become?  when i think i can overcome  it runs even deeper  everything that matters is gone  all the hands of hope have withdrawn  could you try to help me hang on?  it runs...    i straight  i won't crack  on my way  and i can't turn back  i'm okay  i'm on track  on my way  and i can't turn back  i stayed  on this track  gone too far  and i can't come back  i stayed  on this track  lost my way  can't come back i am the voice inside your head and i control you  i am the lover in your bed and i control you  i am the sex that you provide and i control you  i am the hate you try to hide and i control you  i take you where you want to go  i give you all you need to know  i drag you down i use you up  mr. self destruct  i speak religion's message clear and i control you  i am denial guilt and fear and i control you  i am the prayers of the naive and i control you  i am the lie that you believe and i control you  i take you where you want to go  i give you all you need to know  i drag you down i use you up  mr. self destruct  i am the needle in your vein and i control you  i am the high you can't sustain and i control you  i am the pusher i'm a whore and i control you  i am the need you have for more and i control you  i am the bullet in the gun and i control you  i am the truth from which you run and i control you  i am the silencing machine and i control you  i am the end of all your dreams and i control you  i take you where you want to go  i give you all you need to know  i drag you down i use you up  mr. self destruct just a reflection  just a glimpse  just a little reminder  of all the what abouts  and all the might have  could have beens  another day  some other way  but not another reason to continue  and now you're one of us  the wretched    the hopes and prays  the better days  the far aways  forget it    it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to  it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to  did it?  it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to  it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to  did it?    now you know  this is what it feels like  now you know  this is what it feels like  the clouds will part and the sky cracks open  and god himself will reach his fucking arm through  just to push you down  just to hold you down  stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss  and it's hard to believe it could come down to this  back at the beginning  sinking  spinning    and in the end  we still pretend  the time we spend  not knowing when  you're finally free  and you could be  but it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to  it didn't turn out quite the way that you wanted it    now you know  this is what it feels like  now you know  this is what it feels like    you can try to stop it but it keeps on coming  you can try to stop it buti believe i can see the future  'cause i repeat the same routine  i think i used to have a purpose  but then again  that might have been a dream    i think i used to have a voice  now i never make a sound  i just do what i've been told  i really don't want them to come around  oh no    every day is exactly the same  every day is exactly the same  there is no love here and there is no pain  every day is exactly the same    i can feel their eyes are watching  in case i lose myself again  sometimes i think i'm happy here   sometimes   sometimes  yet i still pretend    i can't remember how this got started  oh  but i can tell you exactly how it will end    every day is exactly the same  every day is exactly the same  there is no love here and there is no pain  every day is exactly the same    i'll write it on a little piece of paper  i'm hoping  someday  you might find  well i'll hide it behind something  they won't look behind    i am still inside her  a little bit comes bleeding through  i wish this could've been any other way  but i just don't know  i don't know what else i can do    every day is exactly the same  every day is exactly the same  there is no love here and there is no pain  every day is exactly the same    every day is exactly the same  every day is exactly the same  there is no love here and there is no pain  every day is exactly the same   every day is the same!  getting a little erratic here  and i don't know who to trust  i guess they got a way of reading my mind  i guess i gotta adjust  got my arms they flip flop flip flop flip  got my head on a spring  well i thought i got you on my side  i haven't got fucking anything    i'm just a face in the crowd  nothing to worry about  not even tryin' to stand out    i'm getting smaller  and smaller and smaller  and i have nothing to say  its only taken away  i just behave and obey  i'm afraid that i'm starting to fade away    i cannot see through the cracks  when i'm pressed up on the wall  i'm not looking to stand up real high  i'd be happy to crawl  i think i'm losing my grip  but i can still make a fist  you know i still got my one good arm  that i can beat  oh that i can beat myself with up with    i'm just a face in the crowd  nothing to worry about  not even tryin' to stand out    i'm getting smaller  and smaller and smaller  and i have nothing to say  it's only taken away  i just behave and obey  i'm afraid i am starting to fade away    and for what it is worth  i really used to believe  maybe theirs some great thing  that we could achieve  and now i can't tell the difference  don't know what to feel  between what i've been trying to hard to see  and what appears to be real    fading away  fading away  fading away  fading away    my world is getting smaller everyday-yea-yea-yea  my world is getting smaller everyday-yea-yea-yea   and that's ok     my world is getting smaller everyday-yea-yea-yea  my world is getting smaller everyday-yea-yea-yea   and that's ok  they're starting to open up the sky  they're starting to reach down through  and it feels like we're living in that split-second of a car crash  and time is slowing down  and if we only had a little more time  and this time is all there is    do you remember the time we...  and all the times we...  and should have...  and were going to...  i know  and i know you remember  how we could justify it all  and we knew better  in our hearts  we knew better  and we told ourselves it didn't matter  and we chose to continue  and none of that matters anymore  in the hour of our twilight  and soon it will be all said and done  and we will all be back together as one  if we will continue at all      shame on us  doomed from the start  may god have mercy on our dirty little hearts  shame on us  for all we've done  and all we ever were  just zeros and ones    and you never get away  and you never get to take the easy way  and all of this is a consequence  brought on by our own hand  if you believe in that sort of thing  and did you ever really find  when you closed your eyes  any place that was still  and at peace?  and i guess i just wanted to tell you  as the light starts to fade  that you are the reason  that i am not afraid  and i guess i just wanted to mention  as the heavens will fall  we will be together soon if we  will be anything at all        shame on us  shame on us   doomed from the start  may god have mercy on our dirty little hearts  shame on us  shame on us   for all we have done  and all we ever were  just  just zeros and ones i pushed the button and elected him to office  and  he pushed the button  and he dropped the bomb  you pushed the button  and could watch it on the television  those motherfuckers didn't last too long    i'm sick of hearing 'bout the have and have-not's  have some personal accountability  the biggest problem with the way that we are doing things is  the more we let you have  the less that i'll be keeping for me    well  i used to stand for something  now i'm on my hands and knees  turning in my god for this one  and he signs his name with a capital g    don't give a shit about the temperature in guatemala  don't really see what all the fuss is about

think you have a mission  to purge us of the seven deadly sins  should first sort out the basic food position  then start your preaching  that's where it begins    you lot  who preach restraint and watch your waist as well  should learn for all time how the world is run  however much you twist  whatever lies you tell  food is the first thing  morals follow on      so first make sure that those  who now are starving  get proper helpings  when we all start carving  what keeps mankind alive  the fact that millions  are daily tortured  stifled  punished  silenced  oppressed  mankind can keep alive  thanks to its brilliance  at keeping its humanity repressed  for once  you must not try to shirk the facts  mankind is kept alive by bestial acts    you say the girls may strip with your permission  you draw the line dividing art from sin  so first sort out the basic food position  then start your preaching  that's where it begins    you lot  who bank on your desires and our disgust  should learn for all time how the world is run  whatever lies you tell  however much you twist  food is the first thing  morals follow on        mankind can keep alive  thanks to its brilliance  at keeping its humanity repressed  for once  you must not try to shirk the facts  mankind is kept alive by bestial acts at this time of night  when the crowds have passed  we're the last to leave  we need some company  no need to look so shy  don't even wonder why  you know the reason that we need this company  i've been sitting here  looking out for you  someone just like me  who's maybe had a drink or two      i don't want another drink or fight  i want a lover  i don't care whether it's wrong or right  i want a lover tonight  tonight    outside the dawn is breaking  looks like it's started raining  we'll catch a cab  and soon be driving home  no need to look so shy  don't even wonder why  you'll know the reason just as soon as we get home  you've been sitting there  wondering what to do  i've been standing here  waiting to make the first move    [chorus: x2]    this anticipation is a stimulation  no need for conversation as we're driving home  put your arms around me  it doesn't mean you love me  just that you want me and you need my company  driving through the night  it's so exciting  turning off the light without another thought tonight    [chorus: x2]     i want

in love with me  but you know as well as i do  i can never think of anyone but you     all my life   all my life  i want to wake up     play with fire  play with guns  it's easy to impress someone  turning in my sleep  you called me fool  to fall in love  is it so uncool?    now  i want to wake up  how i want to wake up  now  i want to wake up  wake up     wake up  wake up  wake up  wake up -

that was almost dead  my body a prison  why did i do it?  someone told me not to  but still went through it      it is not easy  but don't give up now  it is not easy  happiness is an option    needed somewhere to clear  my head  find some strength  a warmer bed  maximum love in a  minimal world  i'd never achieved it  but then i believed it  so when i lost it  how?  i'm not sure now   it was a strange feeling  like a paw repealing itself    [chorus: x2]    i can wake up in the morning  and not believe what i see  look in the mirror  and think if that's really me  i don't think i suit my face  it's not a catastrophe  it's more a philosophy  like the russians  wondering why  we're born under a blue sky  but die in a dark forest    [chorus: x2]    this is neither old nor new  it's always  forever  somewhere between sense  and ambition  pleasure and decision  we have to make a choice  what do we want?  everyone singing  "war  what is it good for?"  while planning the next one?    i don't need to win  you don't have to lose  we can choose  happiness is an option    it is not easy  but don't give up now  it is not easy  happiness is an option    it is not easy  the war within us  but it gets easier  the more we learn  i don't need to win  you don't need to lose  we can choose  happiness is an option    it is not easy  but don't give up now  it is not easy  happiness is an option  i don't need to win  you don't need to lose  we can choose  happiness is an option ask me why   i say it's most unusual  how can i even try to explain  why today i feel like dancing  singing

i'm going through  because it isn't the sort of thing i would normally do    ask me what   ta ra ra ra   i say i think it's good for you  ta ra ra ra ra   believe it or not  i know where it's all

believe what i have said  take a look  my eyes are red  'cause i'm so in love with you  but all those sleepless night in bed  when you've been out somewhere instead  i wonder if you care and cannot bear the proof  it hurts too much to face the truth  to face the truth    a lawyer with a case to prove  would sift the evidence  then move  it's the only thing to do  so why then can't i face the facts?  sift this evidence that backs  i am so in love with you  but all the nights when you have said  you must be somewhere else instead  i wonder where you go  but daren't expose the proof  it hurts too much to face the truth  to face the truth  to face the truth    you are the only one  the only one    you know it hurts me when you lie  sometimes it even makes me cry  'cause i'm so in love with you  if you don't believe what i have said  take a look  my eyes are red  'cause i'm so in love with you  but all the nights you don't show up  i know it's time i should grow up  i ask you if you care  you stand and stare aloof  it hurts too much to face the truth  to face the truth  to face the truth   well i don't know why i was dreaming about you  but i do know that i was dancing without you  then you smiled  and i was lost  you fall in love  why count the cost?    all i gave to you  all you made me do  i react when i hear people ask      was it worth it?  yes it's worth living for  was it worth it?  yes it's worth giving more    if i'd had my way this would have happened much sooner  but until that day it was only a rumour  all at once you changed my life  and led me in to paradise    where i had to do  what i wanted to  i react when i hear people ask        i reserve the right to live  my life this way  and i don't give  a damn when i hear people say  i'll pay the price that others pay    because it's worth it  yes it's worth living for  because it's worth it  yes it's worth living for    all i gave to you  all you made me do  i react when i hear people ask        and i reserve  what?   the right to live  where?   my life this way  how?   i couldn't give  a damn when i  what?   hear people say  who?   i'll pay the price  that others pay        i don't know why  i never thought i'd fall in love  i don't know why  i don't know why  i never thought i'd fall in love  i don't know why  i don't know why darling  you were wonderful  you really were quite good  i enjoyed that  though  of course  no one understood  a word of what was going on  they didn't have a clue  they couldn't understand your sense of humour like i do    you're much too kind  i smiled with murder on my mind    yesterday  when i was mad  and quite prepared to give up everything  admitting  i don't believe  in anyone's sincerity  and that's what's really got to me    you have a certain quality  which really is unique  expressionless  such irony  although your voice is weak  it doesn't really matter 'cause the music is so loud  of course it's all on tape  but no one will find out    you hated me too  but not as much as i hated you    yesterday  when i was mad  and quite prepared to give up everything  admitting  i don't believe  in anyone's sincerity  and that's what's really got to me    then  when i was lonely  i thought again  and changed my mind    then we posed for pictures with the competition winners  and argued about the hotel rooms  and where to go for dinner  and someone said: "it's fabulous you're still around today   you've both made such a little go a very long way"    yesterday  when i was mad  and quite prepared to give up everything  admitting  i don't believe  in anyone's sincerity  and that's what's really got to me    yesterday  when i was mad  and quite prepared to give up everything  admitting  i don't believe  in anyone's sincerity  and that's what's really got to me    then  when i was lonely  i thought again  and changed my mind  maybe i didn't treat you  quite as good as i should  maybe i didn't love you  quite as often as i could  little things i should have said and done  i never took the time    you were always on my mind  you were always on my mind    maybe i didn't hold you  all those lonely  lonely times  and i guess i never told you  i am so happy that you're mine  if i made you feel second best  i'm so sorry i was blind    you were always on my mind  you were always on my mind    tell me  tell me that your sweet love hasn't died  give me   one more chance to keep you satisfied  satisfied    little things that i should have said and done  i never took the time  you were always on my mind  you were always on my mind    tell me  tell me that your sweet love hasn't died  give me   one more chance to keep you satisfied  you were always on my mind  you were always on my mind  you were always on my mind  you were always on my mind  you were always on my mind  you were always on my mind    maybe i didn't treat you  quite as good as i should  maybe i didn't love you  quite as often as i could  maybe i didn't hold you  all those lonely lonely times  i guess i never told you  i am so happy that you're mine did you see me coming?  was i that obvious?  for all of a sudden  there were just two of us    you don't have be in "who's who" to know what's what  you don't have to be a high-flyer to catch your slot  the night we met was cold and wet  i needed a drink or two  i saw you standing there and i knew  i'd love to be loved by you    did you see me coming?  was i that obvious?  for all of a sudden  there were just two of us    you don't have to be what's what to know who's who  you don't need the dna to find the proof  then and there my life made sense  you were the evidence    did you see me coming?  was i that obvious?  for all of a sudden  there were just two of us  did you see me coming?  i thought i'd have to make  all of the running  i was all yours to take    am i superstitious or really religious  just "to thyself be true"  but now i think i'm starting to believe in fate  because it delivered you    did you see me coming?  was i that obvious?  for all of a sudden  there were just two of us  did you see me coming?  i thought i'd have to make  all of the running  i

all day  all day  watch them all fall down   all day  all day  domino dancing     remember when we felt the sun   a love like paradise   how hot it burned   a threat of distant thunder   the sky was

i was surprised he spoke so politely  i said i'd liked his show  well he just smiled  i guess it happens nightly  and so  i fell in love    we went to his room  he had a video camera  i was so nervous  i had to try hard not to stammer  he said  'i'm glad you liked the show  that crowd was dope out there tonight  alright  you want to see some more?  well be my guest  you can have a private performance'  i'd fallen in love    i didn't ask why  though he seemed like such a regular guy  he said we could be  secret lovers  just him and me  then he joked  'hey  man!  your name isn't stan  is it?  we should be together!'  and he was passionate  i guess i would rate  him a nine out of ten  by then  i'd fallen in love    when i asked  why have i heard so much  about him being charged  with homophobia and stuff  he just shrugged    next morning we woke  he couldn't have been a nicer bloke  over breakfast made jokes  about dre and his homies and folks  neither of us asked if or when  we would see each other again  but i thought that was cool  'cause i was already late for school  by then  i'd fallen in love i'm here  you're there  come closer  tonight i'm lonely  come here with me  i want it the way it used to be    what is left of love?  tell me  who would even care?  so much time has passed  i'd still meet you anywhere  water under bridge  evening after day  what is left of love  here that didn't drift away?    i can remember days of sun  we knew our lives had just begun  we could do anything  we're fearless when we're young  under the moon  address unknown  i can remember nights in rome  i thought that love would last  a promise set in stone    i'd survive with only memories  if i could change the way i feel  but i want more than only memories  a human touch to make them real    another day  another dream  over the bridge an empty scene  we'd spend the weekend lost in bed and float upstream  i don't know why we moved away  lost in the here and now we strayed  into a new york zone  our promise was betrayed    i was there  caught on tenth avenue  you elsewhere with culver city blues  then and there i knew that i'd lost you    what is left of love?  tell me  who will even care?  so much time has passed  i'd still meet you anywhere  water under bridge  evening after day  what is left of love  here that didn't drift away?    don't give me all your love and pain  don't sell me new york in the rain  let's leave our promises behind  rewind and try again    what remains in time that didn't fade away?  sometimes i need to see  the way it used to be i can remember when this was the future  where it was gonna be at back then  why don't we turn the whole bloody lot down  and make a new start all over again?    i can recall utopian thinking  bold mission statements and tightening of belts  demolition of familiar landmarks  promises made and deals that were dealt    this used to be the future  where it was at back then  let's turn the whole bloody lot down  and start all over again    but that future was exciting  science fiction made fact  now all we have to look forward to  is a sort of suicide pact    was it the dear old future  that created the problems we face?  how do we deal with the fallout  of the age we used to call space?    i can remember planning for leisure  living in peace and freedom from fear  science that promised to make us a new world  religion and prejudice disappear    i can remember when this was the future  where it was gonna be at back then  now religion and nuclear energy have united  to threaten  oh god! amen    this used to be the future  where it was at back then  now religion and nuclear energy have united  oh god! amen    was it the dear old future  that created the problems we face?  how do we deal with the fallout  of the age we used to call space?    this used to be the future  where it was at back then  let's turn the whole bloody lot down  and start all over again    amen try it  try it  try my

too bright    oh the light can carry  all the visions of the sea  oh the light can carry  all the images to me    run to light from shadow  sun gives me no rest  promise offered in the east  broken in the west  chase the sun around the world  i want to look at life  in the available light    all four winds together  can't bring the world to me  shadows hide the play of light  so much i want to see

god  a king  a head of state  a captain of industry  to the movers and the shakers  can't everybody see?    it ought to be second nature  i mean  the places where we live  let's talk about this sensibly  we're not insensitive  i know progress has no patience  but something's got to give    i know you're different  you know i'm the same  we're both too busy  to be taking the blame    i'd like some changes  but you don't have the time  we can't go on thinking  it's a victimless crime    no one is blameless  but we're all without shame  we fight the fire  while we're feeding the flames    folks have got to make choices  and choices got to have voices  folks are basically decent  conventional wisdom would say    well  we read about  the exceptions  in the papers every day    it ought to be second nature  at least  that's what i feel  "now i lay me down in dreamland"  i know perfect's not for real  i thought we might get closer  but i'm ready to make a deal    today is different  and tomorrow the same  it's hard to take the world  the way that it came    too many rapids  keep us sweeping along  too many captains  keep on steering us wrong    it's hard to take the heat  it's hard

one knows about  he says it used to be a farm  before the motor law  and now on sundays i elude the eyes  and hop the turbine freight  to far outside the wire where my  white-haired uncle waits    jump to the ground as the turbo slows  to cross the borderline  run like the wind as excitement shivers  up and down my spine  but down in his barn  my uncle preserved for me  an old machine  for fifty-odd years  to keep it as new  has been his dearest dream    i strip away the old debris  that hides a shining car  a brilliant red barchetta  from a better vanished time  we'll fire up the willing engine  responding with a roar  tires spitting gravel  i commit my weekly crime    wind  in my hair  shifting and drifting  mechanical music  adrenaline surge    well-oiled leather  hot metal and oil  the scented country air    sunlight on chrome  the blur of the landscape  every nerve aware    suddenly ahead of me  across the mountainside  a gleaming alloy air-car  shoots towards me two lanes wide  oh  i spin around with shrieking tires  to run the deadly race  go screaming through the valley  as another joins the chase    ride like the wind  straining the limits  of machine and man  laughing out loud with fear and hope  i've got a desperate plan    at the one-lane bridge  i leave the giants stranded  at the riverside  race back to the farm  to dream with my uncle  at the fireside nature has some new plague  to run in our streets  history some new wrinkle  we are doomed to repeat    fugitives at the bedroom door  lovers pause to find an open store  rain is burning on the forest floor  and the red tide kisses the shore    this is not a false alarm  this is not a test    stay out of the sun  it only burns my skin  sky full of poison  and the atmosphere's too thin    bless the sun  the rain no more  river running like an open sore  black wind falling to the ocean floor  and the red tide washes ashore    this is not a false alarm  this is not a test  nowhere we can fly away  nowhere we can rest  the party is disrupted by  an uninvited guest    deadline approaches  for the weary land  it used to be something  but we let it run down in our hands    too late for debate  too bad to ignore  quiet rebellion leads to open war  bring a sea-change to the factory floor  as the red tide covers the shore    now is the time to turn the tide  now is the time to fight  let us not go gently  to the endless winter night    now is the time to make the time  while hope is still in sight  let us not go gently  to the endless winter nighthe's got a road map of jupiter  a radar fix on the stars  all along the highway  she's got a liquid-crystal compass  a picture book of the rivers  under the sahara    they travel in the time of the prophets  on a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun  like lovers and heroes  and the restless part of everyone  we're only at home when we're on the run  on the run    he's got a star map of hollywood  a list of cheap motels  all along the freeway  she's got a sister out in vegas  the promise of a decent job  far away from her hometown    they travel on the road to redemption  a highway out of yesterday  that tomorrow will bring  like lovers and heroes  birds in the last days of spring  we're only at home when we're on the wing  on the wing    when we are young  wandering the face of the earth  wondering what our dreams might be worth  learning that we're only immortal  for a limited time    time is a gypsy caravan  steals away in the night  to leave you stranded in dreamland  distance is a long-range filter  memory a flickering light  left behind in the heartland    we travel in the dark of the new moon  a starry highway traced on the map of the sky  like lovers and heroes  lonely as the eagle's cry  we're only at home when we're on the fly  on the fly    we travel on the road to adventure  on a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun  like lovers and heroes  and the restless part of everyone  we're only at home when we're on the run  on the run where would you rather be?  anywhere but here  when will the time be right?  anytime but now    on the edge of sleep   i was drifting for half the night  anxious and restless   pressed down by the darkness  bound up and wound up so tight  so many decisions  a million revisions  caught between and light...    wilderness of mirrors  world of polished steel  gears and iron chains  turn the grinding wheel  i run between the shadows  some are phantoms  some are real    where would you rather be?  anywhere but here  when will the time be right?  anytime but now  the doubt and the fear  i know would all disappear  anywhere but here    on the edge of sleep   i heard voices behind the door  the known and the nameless   familiar and faceless  my angels and my demons at war  which one will lose - depends on what i choose  or maybe which voice i ignore...    wilderness of mirrors  streets of cold desire  my precious sense of honor  just a shield of rusty wire  i hold against the chaos  and the cross of holy fire    wilderness of mirrors  so easy to deceive  my precious sense of rightness  is sometimes so naive  so that which i imagine  is that which i believe    on the edge of sleep  i awoke to a sun so bright  rested and fearless  cheered by your nearness  i knew which direction was right  the case had been tried by the jury inside  the choice between darkness and light... i knew he was different  in his sexuality  i went to his parties  as a straight minority  it never seemed a threat to my masculinity  he only introduced me to a wider reality    as the years went by  we drifted apart  when i heard that he was gone  i felt a shadow cross my heart  but he's nobody's    hero - saves a drowning child  cures a wasting disease  hero - lands the crippled airplane  solves great mysteries    hero - not the handsome actor  who plays a hero's role  hero - not the glamor girl  who'd love to sell her soul  if anybody's buying  nobody's hero    i didn't know the girl  but i knew her family  all their lives were shattered  in a nightmare of brutality  they try to carry on  try to bear the agony  try to hold some faith  in the goodness of humanity    as the years went by  we drifted apart  when i heard that she was gone  i felt a shadow cross my heart  but she's nobody's    hero - the voice of reason  against the howling mob  hero - the pride of purpose  in the unrewarding job    hero - not the champion player  who plays the perfect game  not the glamor boy  who loves to sell his name  everybody's buying  nobody's hero    as the years went by  we drifted apart  when i heard that you were gone  i felt a shadow cross my heart    hero well  you can stake that claim   good work is the key to good fortune  winners take that praise  losers seldom take that blame  if they don't take that game  and sometimes the winner takes nothing  we draw our own designs  but fortune has to make that frame    we go out in the world and take our chances  fate is just the weight of circumstances  that's the way that lady luck dances  roll the bones    why are we here?  because we're here  roll the bones  why does it happen?  because it happens  roll the bones    faith is cold as ice   why are little ones born only to suffer  for the want of immunity  or a bowl of rice?  well  who would hold a price  on the heads of the innocent children  if there's some immortal power  to control the dice?    we come into the world and take our chances  fate is just the weight of circumstances  that's the way that lady luck dances  roll the bones    jack  relax.  get busy with the facts.  no zodiacs or almanacs   no maniacs in polyester slacks.  just the facts.  gonna kick some gluteus max.  it's a parallax  you dig?  you move around  the small gets big. it's a rig.  it's action  reaction   random interaction.  so who's afraid  of a little abstraction?  can't get no satisfaction  from the facts?  you better run  homeboy   a fact's a fact  from nome to rome  boy.    what's the deal? spin the wheel.  if the dice are hot  take a shot.  play your cards. show us what you got   what you're holding.  if the cards are cold   don't go folding.  lady luck is golden   she favors the bold. that's cold.  stop throwing stones   the night has a thousand saxophones.  so get out there and rock   and roll the bones.  get busy!now it's come to this  it's like we're back in the dark ages  from the middle east to the middle west  it's a world of superstition    now it's come to this  wide-eyed armies of the faithful  from the middle east to the middle west  pray  and pass the ammunition    so many people think that way  you gotta watch what you say  to them and them  and others too  who don't seem to see to things the way you do    we can only grow the way the wind blows  on a bare and weathered shore  we can only bow to the here and now  in our elemental war    we can only go the way the wind blows  we can only bow to the here and now  or be broken down blow by blow    now it's come to this  hollow speeches of mass deception  from the middle east to the middle west  like crusaders in unholy alliance    now it's come to this  like we're back in the dark ages  from the middle east to the middle west  it's a plague that resists our science    it seems to leave them partly blind  and they leave no child behind  while evil spirits haunt their sleep  while shepherds bless and count their sheep    we can only grow the way the wind blows  on a bare and weathered shore  we can only bow to the here and now  in our elemental war    we can only grow the way the wind blows  we can only bow to the here and now    we can only grow the way the wind blows  we can only bow to the here and now  or be broken down blow by blow  we can only grow the way the wind blows  we can only bow to the here and now  or be broken down blow by blow    like the solitary pine  on a bare  wind blasted shore  we can only grow the way the wind blows  in our elemental war    we can only grow the way the wind blows  we can only bow to the here and now  or be broken down blow by blow the snakes and arrows a child is heir to  are enough to leave a thousand cuts  we build our defenses  a place of safety  and leave the darker places unexplored    sometimes the fortress is too strong  or the love is too weak  what should have been our armor  becomes a sharp and angry sword    our better natures seek elevation  a refuge for the coming night  no one gets to their heaven without a fight  no one    we hold beliefs as a consolation  a way to take us out of ourselves  meditation or medication  a comfort or a promised reward    sometimes the spirit is too strong  or the flesh is too weak  sometimes the need is just too great  for the solace we seek  the suit of shining armor  becomes a keen and bloody sword  no one gets to their heaven without a fight    a refuge for the coming night  a future of eternal light  no one gets to their heaven without a fight  no one    confused alarms of struggle and flight  blood is drained of color  by the flashes of artillery light  no one gets to their heaven without a fight  the battle flags are flown  at the feet of a god unknown  no one gets to their heaven...  no one gets to their heaven without a fight    sometimes the damage is too great  or the will is too weak  what should have been our armor  becomes a sharp and burning sword  no one gets to their heaven without a fight  oh  a refuge for the coming night  a future of eternal light  no one gets to their heaven without a fight  no one    no one gets to their heaven without a fight the best we can agree on  is it could have been worse  what happened to your old  benevolent universe?  you know  the one

most beautiful words i could ever say  and the most beautiful words i could ever say    the worst thing about it all  is that you've never been right  and i'm still not really sure  what started that

know you'll remember that day  and the most beautiful words i could ever say  and the most beautiful words...    some would said they never fear a thing  well  i do  well  i do   and i'm afraid enough for both of us  for me and you  me and you   time  if nothing else  will do its worst  so do me that favor  and tell me the good news first  the good news first    you used to feel that way  the

understand  why a billion other choices are making their demands    talk of a peaceable kingdom  talk of a time without fear  the ones we wish would listen  are never going to hear    justice against the hanged man  knight of wands against the hour  swords against the kingdom  time against the tower    all this time we're shuffling and laying out all our cards  while a billion other dealers are slipping past our guards  all this time we're hoping and praying we all might learn  while a billion other teachers are teaching them how to burn    dream of a peaceable kingdom  dream of a time

wave tops torn into flying spindrift  spindrift    as the waves crash in  on the western shore  it makes me feel uneasy  the spray that's torn away  is an image of the way i feel    what am i supposed to say?  where are the words to answer you  when you talk that way?  ooo-ooo  oh    as sun goes down  on the western shore  the wind blows hard from the east  it whips the sand into a flying spindrift

door  and saw a man she'd never seen before  light skin  light blue eyes  a double-chin and a plastic smile  well  her heart raced as he walked in the door  and took an empty seat next to her at the bar  "my brand new car is parked right outside  how'd ya like to go for a ride?"  and she said "wait a minute i have to think."  he said  "that's fine. may i please buy you a drink"  one drink turned into three or four and they left and got into his car  and they drove away someplace real far    now babe the time has come  how'd ya like to have a little fun?  and she said "if we could only please be on our way  i will not run."    that's when things got out of control  she didn't want to  he had his way  she said  "let's go"  he said  "no way!"  come on babe it's your lucky day  shut your mouth  were gonna do it my way  come on baby don't be afraid  if it wasn't for date rape i'd never get laid    he finished up and he started the car  he turned around and drove back to the bar  he

but a little to the air  from another direction she was calling my eye  it could be an illusion but i might as well try  might as well try    she had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes  and i knew without asking she was into the blues  she wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls  i knew right away she was not like other girls  like other girls    well i ain't never been right as i ain't never been wrong  as everything works out the way it does in this song  cause once in a while you get shown in the light  in the strangest of places if you look at it right    it was the summer of love and i thank the stars above  because the women took a lovin' over me  and just to gain her trust  i bought a microbus  because i sold off all my personal property    a tie-tie-dyed dress  she was a psychedelic mess  we toured to the north  south  east and west  we sold some mushroom tea   we sold some ecstasy   we sold nitrous  opium  acid  heroin and pcp  and now i hear the police coming after me  yes now i hear the police coming after me  the one scarlet with the flowers in her hair   she's got the police coming after me    well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves  all scarlet begonias and a touch of the blues  and there ain't nothin' wrong with the love that's in her eyes  i had to learn the hard way just to let her pass by  let her pass by.  oh just let her pass by janie always said i was a mess  i'm sorry 'bout that mess  i made her bleed  i'm planting my seed  still i knew it could take it if i opened up the rhythm  i knew it could make it  i hope her parents love her    so  feelin' the acid on the brain  still i got that frame i made  her bleed yes she wants that lovin' you see  well if you live you want to give or get old  and if you never knew that we get old  you live it up  live it up  you get old  believe me when i say    it's the same shit everyday  but i got to know my place  and if you don't it fucks you in your face  i know her parents love her  i hope her parents love her  i hope her parents love her so    billyed back in 1983  what did you do for me  i made her bleed  i'm planting my seed  i knew we could make it  but i only knew that the bitch would break it  i hope her parents love her  so my god look at me  if he had to go i know  i know i'm barely lovin' my holy creed  you never knew that was what you need  oh my god honestly believe it or not its a disease.  i hope her parents love her  i hope her parents love her  so she takes her time when it's time to get ready.  always has her way.  always leaves me

"so good to see you.  i've missed you so much.  so glad it's over.  i've missed you so much  came out to watch you play.  why are you running?"  shrouding all the ground around me  is this holy crow above me.  black as holes within a memory  and blue as our new second sun.  i stick my hand into his shadow  to pull the pieces from the sand.  which i attempt to reassemble  to see just who i might have been.  i do not recognize the vessel   but the eyes seem so familiar.  like phosphorescent desert buttons  singing one familiar song  "so good to see you.  i've missed you so much.  so glad it's over.  i've missed you so much.  came out to watch you play.  why are you running away?"  prying open my third eye.  so good to see you once again.  i thought that you were hiding.  and you thought that i had run away.  chasing the tail of dogma.  i opened my eye and there we were.  so good to see you once again  i thought that you were hiding from me.  and you thought that i had run away.  chasing a trail of smoke and reason.  prying open my third eye. and the angel of the lord came unto me  snatching me up from my place of slumber.  and took me on high and higher still  until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself.  and he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own midwest.  and as we descended cries of impending doom rose from the soil.  one thousand nay a million voices full of fear.  and terror possessed me then.  and i begged "angel of the lord what are these tortured screams?"  and the angel said unto me   "these are the cries of the carrots  the cries of the carrots!  you see  reverend maynard   tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust."  and i sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat  like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared   "hear me now  i have seen the light!  they have a consciousness  they have a life  they have a soul!  damn you! let the rabbits wear glasses! save our brothers!"  can i get an amen? can i get a hallelujah? thank you jesus.  life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on.  this is necessary.  it was daylight when you woke up in your ditch.  you looked up at your sky then.  that made blue be your color. you had your knife there with you too.  when you stood up there was goo all over your clothes.  your hands were sticky.  you wiped them on your grass  so now your color was green.  oh lord  why did everything always have to keep changing like this.  you were already getting nervous again.  your head hurt and it rang when you stood up.  your head was almost empty.  it always hurt you when you woke up like this.  you crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk   waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you.  you can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it.  "if god is our father " you thought  "then satan must be our cousin."  why didn't anyone else understand these important things?  you got to your car and tried all the doors.  they were locked. it was a red car and it was new.  there was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat.  out across your field  you could see two tiny people walking by your woods.  you began to walk towards them.  now red was your color and  of course   those little people out there were yours too. he had a lot to say.  he had a lot of nothing to say.  we'll miss him.  so long.  we wish you well.  you told us how you weren't afraid to die.  well then  so long.  don't cry.  or feel too down.  not all martyrs see divinity.  but at least you tried.  standing above the crowd   he had a voice that was strong and loud.  we'll miss him.  ranting and pointing his finger  at everything but his heart.  we'll miss him.  no way to recall  what it was that you had said to me   like i care at all.  so loud.  you sure could yell.  you took a stand on every little thing  and so loud.  standing above the crowd   he had a voice so strong and loud and i  swallowed his facade cuz i'm so  eager to identify with  someone above the ground   someone who seemed to feel the same   someone prepared to lead the way  with  someone who would die for me.  will you? will you now?  would you die for me?  don't you fuckin' lie.  don't you step out of line.  don't you fuckin' lie.  you've claimed all this time that you would die for me.  why then are you so surprised to hear your own eulogy?  he had a lot to say.  he had a lot of nothing to say.  come down.  get off your fuckin' cross.  we need the fuckin' space to nail the next fool martyr.  to ascend you must die.  you must be crucified  for our sins and our lies  goodbye something has to change.  un-deniable dilemma.  boredom's not a burden  anyone should bear.  constant over stimulation numbs me  and i wouldn't have  it any other way.  it's not enough.  i need more.  nothing seems to satisfy.  i don't want it.  i just need it.  to breathe  to feel  to know i'm alive.  finger deep within the borderline.  show me that you love me and that we belong together.  relax  turn around and take my hand.  i can help you change  tired moments into pleasure.  say the word and we'll be  well upon our way.  blend and balance  pain and comfort  deep within you  till you will not want me any other way.  it's not enough.  i need more.  nothing seems to satisfy.  i don't want it.  i just need it.  to breathe  to feel  to know i'm alive.  knuckle deep inside the borderline.  this may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to.  relax. slip away.  something kinda sad about  the way that things have come to be.  desensitized to everything.  what became of subtlety?  how can it mean anything to me  if i really don't feel anything at all?  i'll keep digging till  i feel something.  elbow deep inside the borderline.  show me that you love me and that we belong together.  shoulder deep within the borderline.  relax. turn around and take my hand.here from the kings mountain view  here from the wild dream come true  feast like a sultan i do  on treasures and flesh never few    but i  i would wish it all away  if i thought i'd lose you just one day    the devil and his had me down  in love with the dark side i've found  dabbling all the way down  up to my neck soon to drown    but you changed all that for me  lifted me up turned me round    so i  i  i  i   i would  i would  i would  wish this all away    prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn  begged like a hooker all night long  tempted the devil with my song  and got what i wanted all along    but i  i would  if i could  i would  wish it away  wish it away  wish it all away  wanna wish it all away    no pressure could hold sway  or justify my kneeling away my center    so if i could i'd wish it all away  if i thought tomorrow they'd take you away  you're my piece of mind  my all  i said  i'm just trying to hold on one more day    damn my eyes  damn my eyes  damn my eyes if they should compromise our fulcrum  what you need divides me then  i might as well be gone    shine on forever  shine on benevolent sun  shine down upon the broken  shine until the two become one  shine on forever  shine on benevolent sun  shine on upon the severed  shine until the two become one  divided  i'm withering away  divided  i'm withering away  shine on upon the many  light our way  benevolent sun    breathe in union  breathe in union  breathe in union  breathe in union  so as one survive  another the day and season  silence  leech  and save your poison  silence  leech  and stay out of my way eye on the tv  cause tragedy thrills me  whatever flavor it happens to be  like  killed by the husband"  "drowned by the ocean"  shot by his own son  she used a poison  in his tea  and kissed him goodbye  that's my kind of story  it's no fun until someone dies    don't look at me like  i am a monster  frown out your one face  but with the other  stare like a junkie  into the tv  stare like a zombie    while the mother holds her child  watches him die  hands to the sky crying   "why  oh why?"    cause i need to watch things die  from a distance  vicariously i live while the whole world dies  you all need it too  don't lie    why can't we just admit it?

there'll be sweat pourin'    so pick and choose your weapon but don't slip  i'm here to kill you boys with the flex of my mic grip  so pump your fist like this  but don't miss  the hook and the break when you decide to dance to this  lyrical concept that's meant for the dance floor  i know you adore 'cause that's what you came for  the ice rhymer is back and livin' large  and when i'm at a show you better wear camouflage  'cause there was plenty who thought i couldn't swing this  but now all i get from the crowd is just a pumped fist  so sing along with the chorus 'cause it's a hit  or stay at home alone 'cause ice will be workin' it      work it  work it  work it  work it  work it  work it  work  it  work it. work it  ice  yea! c'mon and work it baby  work it  work it  work it  work it

because i'm cool as an ice  pack  you're lovin' everything when i think of a new track  i keep my rhyme flowin'  notice it's right on time  and separate the wax and keep my mic in line  so put your body in motion and let me know that you're there  and those playin' the wall don't be scared  'cause it's a foundation of breaks put to a beat  strong as concrete 'cause i'm rockin' the beat  i'm in rock mode now' cause i'm steppin' like a soldier  move to the groove and try to hold your composure  never the less i'm back to attack  i came to manifest  and express to this dope track  blow off the lid for the kid i get nice  that's why the ladies scraem...oh! vanilla ice!  forthcomin' i'm risin' to the top  the real definition of funk is put to hip hop  that's what i though  you're cause by the friction  pens to the pad when i'm shakin' the mixin'  what i like to hear is a drummer get wicked  the tone of a vocal thrown and then kick it  don't be surprised if your eyeballs swell  i know it's hard to regard 'cause i'm loved by the females  masses of many  which is plenty  comes to a halt  no one's in the runnin'  so i guess that is my fault  so pump up the crowd and give 'em somethin' to step to  my dj's at his max to enhance what i bring you  the concepts hittin' so follow along like a cookbook  acknowledge the pros from all the titles i took  yea  the crowd's at ease when i breat through the mic end  as i whip up a dance better move all the mic stands  i go to work on the floor like a wet mop  if you've ever been moved  check it out when i rock        throw your hands in the air and let's get hyper  flip this thing and sting like a viper  rollin' with the rhythm  i did it for my opponent  if there was a crown to be taken  yea  i would own it  believe that my rhyme is spoken like it has to be  with slang to stain it's a sheer catastrophe  sheer to the point  to the point it's like lethal  the dope that i'm sellin' is not even illegal  but  still knowck you out with clout to make you shout  to rock the party people sho 'em what it's all about  money  yea  is the key to all problems  if you believe that  then you should surely solve 'em  'cause i got the key  the key to attack  the knowledge from my dome  from the top of my track  to my foes  i can show i can flow 'cause i'm legit  thinkin' of a new dance  ice will be workin' it     oh yea...in my dreams i envision myself at the ocean  beautiful girls rubbin' me down with some lotion  even though you know i flow as cold as an ice cube  let me tell you how it is to make love on an inner tube  floatin' on

smile and forecast  weather's getting better  if you never let a girl rain all over you  and just when i thought that my vista was golden in hue  one thousand umbrellas opened to spoil the view    one billion salt seas  recalled from school atlas  alas would be filled to the brim  sunny jim couldn't jump it  how can i be pleased  when i'm handed the keys  to a town they call misery  oh oh misery    so with a mop and a bucket  i'll just say forget her  and carry on sweeping up  where i've been weeping  the jesters will creep in  to strike down the newly crowned monarch  of misery oh oh misery

 workers  slaves and farmers   nurses  queens and drones.  wish they'd leave my head tonight   let me rest my bones.     ziggedy zig zag just look at 'em. ziggedy zag  hey hey     a billion feet sound just like a billion drums.  a bed is creaking as the messiah comes.  the cars are crashing and the bacon is hacked.  the coffin's lowered and the lunches get packed.  still segregating 'cause we insects are too proud.  doesn't matter what colour of cat you are there's no dogs allowed.    and the screaming sky won't let me sleep.  the stars are laughing at us   as we crawl on and on across this antheap.    war planes go over but no wages go 'round.  a sign goes up to say hey we're twin towned.  the dough is rising but no bread will be baked.  the fur is genuine but the orgasm's faked.  we're spending millions to learn to speak porpoise   when human loneliness is still a deafening noise.    and the screaming sky won't let me sleep.  the stars are laughing at us   as we crawl on and on across this antheap.    soldiers  workers  slaves and farmers   nurses  queens and drones.  wish they'd leave my head tonight   and let me rest my bones.    and all the world's babies are crying still.  while all the police cars harmonize with power drills.  as jets and kettles form a chord with screeching gulls.  accompanied by truncheons keeping time on human skulls.    and the screaming sky won't let me sleep.  the stars are laughing at us   as we crawl on and on past lovers who'll leap.  on and on past widows who'll weep.  on and on no more than skin deep.  on and on across this antheap. i'm floating over strange land   it's a soulless  sequined  showbiz moon.  i'm floating over strange land   and then stranger still  there's no balloon.  but i'm getting higher   wafted up by

my eyes are closed.     i'm skating over thin ice   upon blunted blades of metal soft.  i'm skating over thin ice   while some nonesuch net holds me aloft.  but i'm getting higher   lifted up on lucks' circus wire 'til the...    chalkhills and children   anchor my feet.  chalkhills and children   bringing me back to earth   eternally and ever ermine street.    even i never know where i go when my eyes are closed.  even i never spied that the scenes were posed.  even i never knew this is what i'd be.  even eyes never mean that you're sure to see.    still i'm getting higher   rolling up on three empty tyres  'til the...    chalkhills and children   anchor my feet.  chalkhills and children   bringing me back to earth   eternally and ever ermine street.    i'm soaring over hushed crowds   the reluctant cannonball it seems.  i'm soaring over hushed crowds   i'm propelled up here by long dead dreams.    still i'm getting higher   icarus regrets and retires puzzled.    chalkhills and children   anchor my feet.  chalkhills and children   oddly complete.   even i never know where i go when my eyes are all closed.     here i go again. man acting like a farmer and   he's treated

famous'  all he would say  all he would say  'just like a household name' is  all he would say    methinks world is for you  made of what you believe  if it's false or if it's true  you can read it in your bible  or on the back of this record sleeve    i bought myself a liarbird  things got more and more absurd  it changed to a cuckoo  and expanded filling up with all i gave    i bought myself a big mistake  he grew too greedy  bough will break  and then we will find that liarbirds  are really flightless on their own    all he would say  is 'i can make you famous'  all he would say  all he would say  'just like a household name' is  all he would say    methinks world is for you  there's no handing it back  if it's false or it's true  you can read it in your prayer book  or on the side

unravel   all exotic fish i find like jason and the argonauts    there may be no golden fleece   but human riches i'll release    i was in a land where men force women to hide their facial features   and here in the west it's just the same but they're using make-up veils.  i've seen acts of every shade of terrible crime from man-like creatures   and i've had the breath of liars blowing me off course in my sails.    seems the more i travel   from the foam to gravel   as the nets unravel   all exotic fish i find like jason and the argonauts    there may be no golden fleece   but human riches

blue eyes that look green to me.  and then she approached me.  oh boy    miss cooper  i suppose?  let's stop playing games.  i'm on the job here  let's come to terms.  she tried to wind me up with

failed  to explain our universe in rational terms.    consequently the power of magic  has gradually emerged from our conscious minds  to fathom the unfathomable.    our most distinguished scientists  reluctantly admit that mankind is nothing  but some billion creatures   sitting on a piece of solar driftwood floating in space.    magic is the art of influencing the course  of events by the intervention  of spiritual forces or some other occult device.    according to arthur c. clarke  any sufficiently advanced technology  is indistinguishable from magic.    early civilization often mistook  the unexplainable world around them to be magic.    rupert sheldrake in his book  seven experiments that could change the world  has stated that scientists' attitude  toward their experiments affect  the results of their experiments.    there is no such thing as a definite  fact in science and therefore the irrationality of magic  plays an important part in our rational world.    werner heisenberg  the leading 20th century  physicist has stated that mass  is a physical interpretation of energy.    religious organizations have understood the power of magic  and therefore monopolized the interpretation  of the supernatural to control the human mind.    the universe as a whole is beyond explanation.    only at the end of the 20th. century  the roman-catholic church admitted   that the great visionary galileo galilei was in fact correct.    the second millennium has come to an end.  scientists have to admit that the universe is magic. her name was julie  when she took me on a

you're lying  i love it   you're lying  i love it   you're lying    julie stopped her car  the sun had gone and left one of these dark red skies  she looked in my eyes and with a smile in her face she said  "of course i'm lying.  but i think i love you."    take me on the highway  you're going much too far  you're lying even better  when you drive a car  you're lying 'til the sundown  so look into my face  you're lying  i love it   you're lying  i love it   you're lying  i love it   you're lying  i love it   you're lying    i love your games  i love your lies  i love your games  look in my eyes  take me in your arms and hold me tight just for tonight  i need no drugs i love your lies  you hide me from the night  you're lying  i'm buying  i'm buying every word  i love your lies  i love your games
